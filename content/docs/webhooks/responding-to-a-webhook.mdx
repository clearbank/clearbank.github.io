## Handling a webhook

The webhook sent by ClearBank® acts as a verification mechanism.
It is important that you verify that it is ClearBank® that has sent you the webhook and subsequently, ClearBank® verifies that you have successfully received the webhook (based on your response acknowledging receipt).

We have provided an example C# controller in the [ClearBank fi-api-101 Github Repository](https://github.com/clearbank/fi-api-101) which shows how to calculate the Hash value and verify the digital signature.

The handling of a webhook can be thought of in three different parts: Verification, Response and finally Processing.

### Verification

Step 1 is webhook verification. Here you must verify that ClearBank® is the true source of the webhook, and that it hasn't been tampered with.

To verify the integrity of the webhook received from ClearBank®:
- Download a Public Key by clicking the **Download Public Key** button on the Webhook Management page of the Institution portal.
- Hash the request body using `SHA 256`
- Convert the `DigitalSignature` Request Header value from `Base64` encoded string into the byte array
- Verify the signature using the `RSA` algorithm

After verification you can then respond accordingly.

### Response

If you were able to successfully verify that ClearBank® was the true source of the webhook then you must return a `200` HTTP response, which includes the `Nonce` number in the `response body`  and a valid `DigitalSignature`.
If your response is invalid, we will consider it as a failed webhook. Likewise if you are not able to verify the webhook source then you should respond with a reasonable status code/error code to signify that the webhook should be treated as failed.

A webhook response must be sent in less than 5 seconds. Any response provided after 5 seconds will be considered a failed webhook. 

ClearBank® will retry failed webhooks every 15 minutes for 24 hours unless a successful response is returned by you.

To create the webhook digital signature:
- Take the Nonce number from the webhook and place it in the body of the response (e.g. `{"nonce": <value>}`)
- Hash the response body using `SHA 256`
- Sign the hash with your `Private Key` and attach the signed hash as `Base64` encoded in the `DigitalSignature` Response Header

> Your Private Key needs to correspond to a Public Key which has been used to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Please refer to [creating your authentication profile](/#creating-your-authentication-profile) for more information.

Example HTTP request:
```
POST http://yourdomain.com/sample/webhook HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 72
Digitalsignature: YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
X-Request-Id: f0309d95-4f68-4ecd-9c8d-b2d08d9fedd8

{"Type":"FITestEvent","Version":1,"Payload":"test me","Nonce":1448545215}
```

Example HTTP response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Digitalsignature: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"Nonce": 1448545215
}
```

### Processing

The processing stage covers everything that happens in your system after receipt of a webhook. Because of the 5 second timeout we recommend any processing on your side should be done after responding to the webhook request.
