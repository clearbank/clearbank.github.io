## Responding to a webhook

The webhook sent by ClearBank® acts as a verification mechanism.
You verify that it is ClearBank® that has sent you the webhook and subsequently, ClearBank® needs to verify that you have successfully received the webhook (based on your response acknowledging receipt).
This verification occurs when you return a `200` HTTP response, which includes the `Nonce` number in the `response body`  and your `DigitalSignature`.
If your response is invalid, we will consider it as a failed webhook.
ClearBank® will send the webhook every 15 minutes for 24 hours unless a successful response is returned by you.

To verify the integrity of the webhook received from ClearBank®:
- Download a Public Key that is specific to your institution by clicking the **Download Public Key** button on the Webhook Management page of the Institution portal.
- Hash the request body using `SHA 256`
- Convert the `DigitalSignature` Request Header value from `Base64` encoded string into the byte array
- Verify the signature using the `RSA` algorithm

To create the webhook digital signature:
- Take the Nonce number from the webhook and place it in the body of the response (e.g. `{"nonce": <value>}`)
- Hash the response body using `SHA 256`
- Sign the hash with your `Private Key` and attach the signed hash as `Base64` encoded in the `DigitalSignature` Response Header

> Your Private Key needs to correspond to a Public Key which has been used to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Please refer to [creating your authentication profile](/#creating-your-authentication-profile) for more information.
