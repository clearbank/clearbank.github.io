## Responding to a webhook

The webhook sent by ClearBank® acts as a verification mechanism.

You verify that it is ClearBank® that has sent you the webhook and subsequently, ClearBank® needs to verify that you have successfully received the webhook (based on your response acknowledging receipt).
This verification occurs when you return a `200` HTTP response, which includes the `Nonce` number in the `response body`  and your `DigitalSignature`.
If your response is invalid, we will consider it as a failed webhook.

Webhook responses must be sent in less than 5 seconds. Any response provided after 5 seconds will be considered a failed webhooks. For this reason we recommend that acceptance and processing of webhooks are handled seperately, verification must be done synchronously but processing should be done asynchronously to ensure you can respond quickly.
ClearBank® will retry failed webhooks every 15 minutes for 24 hours unless a successful response is returned by you.

To verify the integrity of the webhook received from ClearBank®:
- Download a Public Key that is specific to your institution by clicking the **Download Public Key** button on the Webhook Management page of the Institution portal.
- Hash the request body using `SHA 256`
- Convert the `DigitalSignature` Request Header value from `Base64` encoded string into the byte array
- Verify the signature using the `RSA` algorithm

To create the webhook digital signature:
- Take the Nonce number from the webhook and place it in the body of the response (e.g. `{"nonce": <value>}`)
- Hash the response body using `SHA 256`
- Sign the hash with your `Private Key` and attach the signed hash as `Base64` encoded in the `DigitalSignature` Response Header

> Your Private Key needs to correspond to a Public Key which has been used to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Please refer to [creating your authentication profile](/#creating-your-authentication-profile) for more information.

Example HTTP request:
```
POST http://yourdomain.com/sample/webhook HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 72
Digitalsignature: YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
X-Request-Id: f0309d95-4f68-4ecd-9c8d-b2d08d9fedd8

{"Type":"FITestEvent","Version":1,"Payload":"test me","Nonce":1448545215}
```

Example HTTP response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Digitalsignature: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"Nonce": 1448545215
}
```

We have provided an example C# controller in the [ClearBank fi-api-101 Github Repository](https://github.com/clearbank/fi-api-101) which shows how to calculate the Hash value and verify the digital signature.
