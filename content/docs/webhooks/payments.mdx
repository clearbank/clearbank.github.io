## Payments

<WebhookSummary
  description='Initiate a payment'
  endpoint='/payments/#initiate-a-payment'
  method='post'
  webhooks={[
    'transaction-settled-webhook-v6',
    'payment-message-assessment-failed-webhook-v1',
    'payment-message-validation-failed-webhook-v1',
    'transaction-rejected-v2'
  ]}
/>

<WebhookPlaceholder render='transaction-settled-webhook-v6' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='payment-message-assessment-failed-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='payment-message-validation-failed-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='transaction-rejected-v2' />

You may occasionally receive multiple webhooks with the same `EndtoEndTransactionId`. In this instance, a duplicate check should take place using the `TransactionId`.
If the same `TransactionId` is used for both payments, the webhook will be a duplicate. In case the TransactionId(s) are different, these will relate to separate transactions.

A full list of webhook documentation is available on ClearBank®'s Knowledge Centre and access can be granted as part of your onboarding journey. Please reach out to your main contact ClearBank® for more information.
