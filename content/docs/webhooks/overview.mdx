## Overview

In response to some events, we generate and send out a webhook message to your defined URL.

Webhooks are asynchronous events and therefore we do not guarantee that they will be delivered in a set order. We do provide at-least-once delivery of webhooks, which means that webhooks may be sent more than once and so your webhook handlers must be idempotent.

> All ClearBank webhooks consist of a `DigitalSignature`, `Type`,`Version`,`Payload` and `Nonce`. `Payload` parameters vary depending on the webhook.
Webhook responses contain a 200 HTTP status code which includes a `Nonce` number in the body and your `DigitalSignature`.

### Anatomy of a webhook

| Element          | Type          | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DigitalSignature` | string        | ClearBank®'s Digital Signature                                                                           |
| `Type`             | string        | The type of the event                                                                                    |
| `Version`          | int           | The webhook version                                                                                      |
| `Nonce`            | int           | Cryptographically secure number generated by ClearBank® for every single webhook. A nonce number is generated randomly and should not be used as a check for duplication |
| `Payload`          | array[object] | Object which contains information related to the webhook |
