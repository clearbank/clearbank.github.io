## Setting up and testing webhook listener URLs

You can create one webhook listener for all events, or separate webhook listeners specific to an event.
In this example, you will setup an `FITestEvent` webhook URL which you can test against the [`TEST POST` endpoint](#test-endpoints)

To manage your webhook definitions and set your webhook listener URLs to each event:
- Log in to the Institution Portal. More information about accessing the portal can be found [here](/#what-you-need-to-get-started)
- From the Menu, select **Institution** > **Webhook Management.**

- Scroll down to **FITestEvent** webhook and Click the Set **URL button**
- Enter the **URL** you want to define as your webhook listener for this event.
- Click Submit to successfully setup the webhook. This will automatically enable it
- To test the webhook, click the **Send test button*
- Enter a test message in the Test webhook window for example, ‘Hello World’ and click **Send**

You should receive a `FITestEvent webhook` to your nominated URL and it should contain the test message in the body.
