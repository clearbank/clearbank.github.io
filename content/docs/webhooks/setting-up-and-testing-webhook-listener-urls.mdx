## Setting up and testing webhook listener URLs

You can create one webhook listener for all events or separate webhook listeners specific to an event.
In this example, you will setup an `FITestEvent` webhook URL, which you can test against the [`TEST POST` endpoint](#test-endpoints).

To manage your webhook definitions and set your webhook listener URLs for each event:
- Log in to the Institution Portal. More information about accessing the portal can be found [here](/#what-you-need-to-get-started).
- From the menu, select **Institution** > **Webhook Management**.

- Search for **Test webhook** and click the **Edit button**.
- Enter the **URL** you want to define as your webhook listener for this webhook and set the webhook status to **Enabled**.
- Click Save to successfully setup the webhook listern URL.
- To test the webhook, click the **Test button**.
- Enter a test message in the Test webhook window for example, ‘Hello World’ and click **Send**.

You should receive a `FITestEvent webhook` to your nominated URL and it should contain the test message in the body.

**You must not include any sensitive information (such as API keys) in your webhook URLs.**
