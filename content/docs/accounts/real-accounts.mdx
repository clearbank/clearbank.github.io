## Real Accounts

A real account is a physical account held with ClearBank® and can be used to send and/or receive payments.
The balance of a real account is also held by ClearBank® and can be viewed via the Institution portal and the ClearBank® API. Real accounts are reconciled for you by ClearBank®.
