## Virtual accounts

A virtual account held with ClearBank is a shadow account which should mirror an account held on your platform.
Each virtual account is linked to a real account held at ClearBank. You can use a virtual account to send and/or receive payments by means of its association with this real account.
The responsibility of managing and reconciling virtual accounts rests with you, which gives you complete control of such accounts.
