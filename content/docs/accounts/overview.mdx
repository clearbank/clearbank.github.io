## Overview

There are several types of accounts that can be created. Which ones you should use will depend on your DSA with ClearBank, and the purpose of the account.   

It is important to select the correct type of account when you create it, as it cannot be amended later and affects the terms of provision, for example, whether the account can be used for safeguarding funds.
