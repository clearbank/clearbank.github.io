## Overview

There are several types of accounts that can be created. Which you should use will depend on your agreement with ClearBank, and the purpose of the account.

When you join ClearBank you are given these five accounts by default:

Your **institution account** is a superset of all your other accounts; your **operating account** holds your own operational funds; and your **general segregation account** can be used for multiple customers' funds that need to be safeguarded. 

You can create additional operational and safeguarding accounts as needed. You can also create virtual accounts within a general safeguarding account or a general client account. It is important to select the correct usage for the account when you create it, as this cannot be amended later. The account usage determines, for example, whether the account can be used for safeguarding funds.

When you create a real sterling account, use the **UsageType** field to select YourFunds, SegregatedDesignated, or SegregatedGeneral, as shown above. If you need to create a client account, you will need to create a safeguarding account through the API and then contact client services, through FreshDesk, to have the type transferred to a client account.

When you create a real multicurrency account, use the **Kind** field to select YourFunds, DesignatedSegregated,  GeneralSegregated, DesignatedClient, or DesignatedClient. 

The UsageType or Kind value selected determines the autogenerated prefix assigned to the account, for example, 'Gen Seg Acc Retl'.

The endpoints described below are used to manage sterling accounts. For multi-currency accounts, see  [Multicurrency Accounts](./multicurrency-accounts).
