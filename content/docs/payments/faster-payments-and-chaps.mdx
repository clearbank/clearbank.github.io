## Faster Payments & CHAPS

When sending payments via the ClearBank® API, both Faster Payments and CHAPS are initiated via the POST/Payments endpoint, while a confirmation of settlement is provided to you via the Transaction Settled webhook.
Please refer to [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) for more information.

#### Faster Payments

ClearBank® accounts support inbound and outbound Faster Payments. At any given time, you can receive or send individual payments of up to £ 250,000.
Faster Payments are not subject to a cut-off time and can be sent or received as and when required.

### CHAPS

ClearBank® accounts support inbound and outbound CHAPS payments. Being that CHAPS is the UK’s high value payment scheme, there is no amount limit associated with inbound or outbound CHAPS payments.
However, you can only send CHAPS payments between 08:00 – 17:00 (UTC) Monday to Friday (excluding UK public holidays).
