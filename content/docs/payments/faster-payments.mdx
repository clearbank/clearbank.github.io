## Faster Payments

When sending payments via the ClearBank® API, Faster Payments are initiated via the POST/Payments/FPS endpoint, while a confirmation of settlement is provided to you via the Transaction Settled webhook.
Please refer to [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) for more information.

ClearBank® accounts support inbound and outbound Faster Payments. You can receive Faster Payments of up to £1,000,000. The transaction limit for an outbound Faster Payment transaction is £250,000. 
Faster Payments are not subject to a cut-off time and can be sent or received as and when required.
