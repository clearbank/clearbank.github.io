## Faster Payments

When sending payments via the ClearBank API, Faster Payments are initiated via the POST/Payments/FPS endpoint, while a confirmation of settlement is provided to you via the Transaction Settled webhook.
Please refer to [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) for more information.

ClearBank accounts support inbound and outbound Faster Payments. You can send and receive Faster Payments of up to £1,000,000. 
Faster Payments are not subject to a cut-off time and can be sent or received as and when required.

Please note that payments originating overseas need to be sent using a separate endpoint: [/v2/payments/fps/singlepayment](#initiate-a-single-faster-payment-originated-overseas).

**Faster Payments Validation**

Each payment is validated against these rules: 

| Element     | Type   | Validation                                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
