## Bacs Inbound Direct Credit

ClearBank® accounts accept inbound Bacs Direct Credit payments. Bacs Direct Credit payments work on a three-day cycle and settles on the third day.

### Settling Inbound Bacs Direct Credit Payments

You are notified of an inbound Direct Credit payment via the Bacs Direct Credit Inbound Payment Created webhook on Day 2 of the three-day cycle.
Confirmation of settlement will be provided via the Transaction Settled webhook on Day 3.

If the payment cannot be applied to the account, ClearBank® will automatically raise an Automated Return of Unapplied Credits Service (ARUCS).
If the payment has been applied, but you still want to return it, you should use these endpoints and specify the reason for return.
ClearBank® will notify you with a Bacs Direct Credit Return Created webhook.
Returns can only be initiated until 15:30 (UTC) the working day after settlement. The payment will be applied to your Bacs Suspense account on the same day and returned on Day 5.
