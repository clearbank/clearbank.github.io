## Authenticate your API calls

ClearBank® uses your API token to authenticate your requests and allows you to securely access protected resources.

The base URL for your environment is either:
- Simulation `https://institution-api-sim.clearbank.co.uk/`
- Production `https://institution-api.clearbank.co.uk/`

Your API token should be included in your HTTP `Authorization` header. Refer to [Common Parameters](#common-parameters]) for more information.

This example request shows the API token in the `Authorization` , `DigitalSignature` and `X-Request-Id` header.

``` json
curl -v -POST https://institution-api-sim.clearbank.co.uk/v1/Test \
  -H “Authorization: Bearer <<your api token>>”
  -H “DigitalSignature: <<digitalsignature>>”
  -H “X-Request-Id: <<X-request-ID>>”      
  -d ‘{ "body": "hello world!" }’      
```

The response shows results from the test call
``` json
{
	"Message": "hello world!"
}
```

To confirm that authentication and signature verification are working as expected, when you send a POST/v1/Test request you will receive a `FITestEvent webhook` from ClearBank®, if subscribed.
We use webhooks to deliver transaction confirmation notifications and account-specific reconciliations to your system as soon as such events occur on your account. Please refer to [Test Webhooks](/webhooks/) for more information.
