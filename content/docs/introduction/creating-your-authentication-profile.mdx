## Creating your authentication profile

Your ClearBank authentication profile links your institution to your public key. Therefore, it must be valid.

Your authentication profile is a combination of:

- A key pair (public/private)
- A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in PKCS #10 format*
- A token


*In the simulation environment, a CSR can be generated using open source solutions. In the production environment, a CSR must be generated using a FIPS 140-2 level 2 compliant Hardware Security Module (HSM) such as Azure KV HSM, Amazon CloudHSM, GoogleCloudHSM (this is not an exhaustive list).

### Create an authentication profile

To create a valid authentication profile:

1. Generate your public key and private key pair in PKCS #8 format
> In the simulation environment, you can utilise open source tools to store your private key. In the production environment, you must use a physical or virtual HSM solution to store your private key (see HSM requirements above)

2. Generate your Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in PKCS #10 format which contains your certificate and public key
3. Save your CSR as a .csr file
4. Sign in to the Institution Portal
5. From the menu, select **Institution > Certificates and Tokens**
6. Click **Generate API Token**

7. Upload your Certificate Signing Request (.CSR) file
8. Enter the **Token Name** and select an **Expiry Date**
9. Click **Generate** to generate your token

Your token will appear in the View Token window:

- You will only be able to view your token once (at the time of creation).
- You can copy the token directly or copy it to your clipboard using the button provided.
- Ensure that you store your token securely now. Otherwise, you will need to generate a new one.
