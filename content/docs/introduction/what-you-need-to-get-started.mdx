Once built, the validation steps are:

1. You test your connectivity and interaction with our full suite of endpoints and webhooks in a simulation environment (sandbox).
2. We take you through a QA process to confirm successful integration.
3. Finally, you will be promoted to use the API in a live/production environment.

### Accessing the Simulation Environment

- Institution Portal URL: https://institution-sim.clearbank.co.uk/

### Accessing the Production Environment

To connect to the API in a production environment, you will need:
