## Versioning

Providing developers with a seamless integration experience is at the core of our API versioning approach. We work in an agile environment and iteratively release the latest versions of individual endpoints and webhooks.

We follow the Semantic Versioning specification (https://semver.org/):

- Internally we update minor and patch versions whenever we add optional functionality and backwards compatible changes.
- Whenever we introduce a breaking change, we will provision a new major version of the API.

All API endpoints are versioned through the URI path; for example, /v2/Accounts. Endpoint details can be found on the Developer Portal.

A backwards compatible change does not affect existing integrations for tolerant readers, for example the addition of new optional fields for an API request, response or a webhook payload. A breaking change could affect existing integrations, for example the addition of a new mandatory field or removal of an existing field.

## Support life cycle

All endpoints and webhooks released by ClearBank will be supported for a minimum of 12 months before these are reviewed for withdrawal.

Following the initial 12-month period, all endpoints and webhooks will be reviewed every 6 months. This review will allow us to decide whether an endpoint or webhook should be withdrawn.
If we decide to withdraw an endpoint or webhook, you will be issued a written notification 6 months prior to the date from which that version will no longer be supported.

This means that all endpoints and webhooks will ideally be supported for a minimum of 18 months (this includes initial support for 12 months along with a 6-month advance notice period prior to withdrawal).

The only exception to this approach would be for us to withdraw an endpoint or webhook sooner due to regulatory or scheme obligations, or in case of API incompatibility.

As a matter of practice, you are urged to ensure that you upgrade to the latest version of an endpoint or webhook as soon as one is released.
