## Overview

FSCS-protected deposits are a part of our embedded banking proposition. An FSCS-protected deposit is a physical account held with ClearBank and is only available to our embedded banking customers for the purpose of sending and/or receiving payments. The balance of an FSCS-protected deposit is held by ClearBank and can be viewed via the ClearBank Portal and the API. Additionally, FSCS-protected deposits are reconciled for you by ClearBank.
