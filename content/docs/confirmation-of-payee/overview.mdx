## Overview

Confirmation of Payee (CoP) gives you greater assurance that you are sending payments to the intended beneficiary. It not only helps in preventing accidental, misdirected payments but also reduces the risk associated with Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud. CoP is a scheme agnostic, peer-to-peer messaging service between accredited participants and sits completely outside of the payment journey. A CoP check can be made prior to setting up a payee or making a payment.

ClearBank is a CoP participant and will provide this account name checking service to those customers who use ClearBank sort codes linked to our bank code.
