## CoP request (outbound)

Sending a CoP request to an external participant requires us to pass the request to the participant so that they can complete a fuzzy matching check on the account in question. 
To be able to send a CoP request (outbound) to an external participant, you will need to use the following POST endpoint so that the exact name registered with the payee’s account can be confirmed:
- POST /open-banking/outbound/v1/name-verification

Once confirmed, we pass the result of the matching check back to you which you can then expose to your customer. Pay.UK have provided a messaging standard for you to follow. Further information about the messaging standard along with your responsibilities can be found in our Confirmation of Payee (CoP) Operating Guide. This document can be found in the Reference Documents section in the Knowledge Centre.

### CoP requests that require secondary reference data (SRD)

CoP checks are typically carried out on accounts that are addressable by sort code and account number, but can also be done for accounts that are addressable through secondary reference data (SRD). SRD-level checks are performed against the underlying account that is identified by the SRD rather than the name held against the sort code and account number. If an account requires SRD and it is not provided, the CoP check cannot be carried out.

To check whether SRD will be required, use:
- POST /open-banking/outbound/v1/srd/validate

If the CoP Check requires SRD, then it must be entered in the SecondaryIdentification field in the CoP request to enable the CoP responder to identify the account.

Supporting SRD-validated CoP checks is mandatory, however the integration that is required to support the SRD Validate endpoint, which is called ahead of the CoP check being sent is optional. Although not mandatory, this will inform your customers as to whether they need the secondary data ahead of sending the CoP check, making for a more streamlined and informed journey.
