## Returning Payments

If a DDI has been set up against an account via AUDDIS, payments may be collected from the account on the third day; for paper instructions, payments maybe collected from the following day.
The timing of the payment is in the control of the service user and does not necessarily follow immediately.

ClearBank® will notify you with a Bacs Direct Debit Inbound Created webhook on Day 2 and confirmation of settlement will be provided with a Transaction Settled webhook on Day 3.

If the payment cannot be applied to the account, ClearBank® will automatically raise an Automated Return of Unpaid Direct Debits (ARUDD).
If the payment has been applied, but you still want to return it, you should use these endpoints and specify the reason for return.
ClearBank® will notify you with a Bacs Direct Debit Return Created webhook.
Returns can only be initiated until 15:30 (UTC) the working day after settlement. The payment will be applied to your Bacs Suspense account on the same day and returned on Day 5.
