Your bank statement is an official summary of financial transactions that have occurred for all European accounts within a calendar month.

Statements can be generated either for all your accounts, or for a specified real account. The statement will be provided via a webhook (refer to [Use webhooks](../api/getting-started/#use-webhooks)).

<Callout colour="blue">The only currency we support in Europe is euro. Set currency to EUR for all statement requests.
</Callout>
