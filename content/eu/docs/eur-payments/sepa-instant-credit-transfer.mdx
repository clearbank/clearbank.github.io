## SEPA Instant Credit Transfer

<Callout colour="green"><h2>SEPA Instant Credit Transfer is coming soon</h2><p>All information on this page describes a solution that is <strong>not yet live in production and therefore could change</strong>. This includes any endpoint and webhook details. The information is being provided early to aid you in integrating with our API in our European simulation environment.</p>
</Callout>

SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) is a payment scheme that enables customers to make and receive payments, up to a maximum value of â‚¬100,000 within a 10 second period. Payments can be sent at any time, including bank holidays and weekends.

<Callout colour="blue">
<p>SCT Inst is currently an optional scheme. New regulation means that by January 2025 all Eurozone participants utilising the euro currency that offer SCT (SEPA Credit Transfer) must also offer SCT Inst.</p>
<p>In the event that a payment is initiated and the beneficiary's bank does not yet participate in SCT Inst, the payment will be rejected.</p>
</Callout>

## Sending an SCT Inst payment

To send an SCT Inst payment, use the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant](#send-an-sct-inst-payment) endpoint.

You will receive the [SEPA Instant Outbound Payment Created webhook](#sepa-instant-outbound-payment-created-webhook). Once the payment has settled, you will receive the [SEPA Instant Outbound Payment Settled webhook](#sepa-instant-outbound-payment-settled-webhook) and the [Customer Accounts Transaction Completed webhook](#customer-accounts-transaction-completed-webhook).

## Request an SCT Inst recall

### Send a recall request

You can send SCT Inst recall requests using the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant/{paymentId}/recall](#recall-an-sct-inst-payment) endpoint. You will receive confirmation via the [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Created webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-created-webhook), and a response via either the [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Settled](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-settled-webhook) or [SEPA Instant Recall Request Rejected](#sepa-instant-recall-request-rejected-webhook) webhooks. 

Recall requests remain valid for a maximum of **15 business days**.  If after 15 business days the receiving party has not responded, the recall request is automatically rejected and the [SEPA Instant Recall Request Rejected webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-request-rejected-webhook) is sent.

### Recall reason codes

Recalls can be requested using the following reason codes:

| Reason | Description                                                       | Time limit to send recall request |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| DUPL   | Duplicate sending                                                 | 10 business days                  |
| TECH   | Technical problems resulting in an erroneous SCT Inst Transaction | 10 business days                  |
| FRAD   | Fraudulent originated SCT Inst Instruction                        | 13 months                         |
| AC03   | Wrong account number in original transfer                         | 13 months                         |
| AM09   | Wrong amount in original transfer                                 | 13 months                         |
| CUST   | Requested by customer                                             | 13 months                         |

## Receive and respond to a recall request

If you receive a recall request, you will be notified via the [SEPA Instant Recall Request Received webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-request-received-webhook). You can review the details of the request by referring to the `OriginalTransactionId` for details of the original payment received and `ReasonCode` for the reason the sending party is requesting the recall (see [Recall reason codes](#recall-reason-codes))

To respond to the recall request, use the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant/{paymentId}/recall-response](#respond-to-an-sct-inst-recall-request) endpoint. Set the `approve` boolean `true` to accept the request or `false` to reject it.

<Callout colour="blue">
If `approve` is set to `true`, a pacs.004 payment will be automatically initiated. You do not need to initiate a payment.
If `approve` is set to `false`, the `rejectionCode` field must be populated with a rejection reason code.
</Callout>

Following your approval of a recall request, the amount of the original payment is ringfenced and returned to the sending party. You can be notified of the status of the status of the return payment via the [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Created webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-created-webhook), [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Settled webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-settled-webhook), and [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Cancelled webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-cancelled-webhook).

Recall requests should be responded to within 15 business days. If after 15 business days you do not accept or reject the recall, ClearBank will automatically reject the request.

The following diagram outlines the process following the unlikely event that there is an issue with the pacs.004 payment that is sent following your approval of an inbound recall request.

![A message flow diagram explaining responding to a recall request with 'approve' followed by the pacs.004 payment being rejected at RT1 resulting in receiving a SEPA Instant Recall Payment Cancelled webhook](/assets/images/sct-inst-recall-payment-cancelled.svg)

Following a rejected pacs.004 and receipt of the SEPA Instant Recall Payment Cancelled webhook, the ringfence is removed from the recall amount and you must re-initiate the recall response using the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant/{paymentId}/recall-response](#respond-to-an-sct-inst-recall-request) endpoint.
