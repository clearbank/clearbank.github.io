## SEPA Instant Credit Transfer

SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) is a pan-European payment scheme that enables real-time euro transfers, delivering funds to the recipient within 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

You can:
- [Send an SCT Inst payment](#send-an-sct-inst-payment)
- [Receive an SCT Inst payment](#receive-an-sct-inst-payment)
- [Recall an SCT Inst payment](#recall-an-sct-inst-payment) (integrating with recall payments is required)
- [Receive and respond to a recall request](#receive-and-respond-to-a-recall-request)
- [Simulate  SCT Inst payment scenarios](#simulate-sct-inst-payment-scenarios)
> You are notified of incoming SCT Inst payments via the [SEPA Instant Inbound Payment Settled webhook](#sepa-instant-inbound-payment-settled-webhook) and the [Customer Accounts Transaction Completed webhook](#customer-accounts-transaction-completed-webhook).

<Callout colour="blue">
It is essential to integrate with the <a href="#customer-accounts-transaction-completed-webhook">Customer Accounts Transaction Completed webhook</a> as funds without any other associated webhook may be deposited to your suspense account.
</Callout>

## Sending an SCT Inst payment

To send an SCT Inst payment, use the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant](#send-an-sct-inst-payment) endpoint.

The SCT Inst scheme does not have a limit for maximum payment amounts, and ClearBank does not impose one. Instead, our clients are responsible for provisioning and managing transaction limits for their underlying customers in accordance with their own operational and risk requirements.

Transactions must be settled within a normal maximum of **5 seconds**, with an upper limit of **10 seconds** permitted only in exceptional circumstances, as mandated by SCT Inst 2025 rulebook.

You will receive the [SEPA Instant Outbound Payment Created webhook](#sepa-instant-outbound-payment-created-webhook). If 10 seconds pass without settlement, you'll receive the [SEPA Instant Outbound Payment Delayed webhook](#sepa-instant-outbound-payment-delayed-webhook). Once the payment has settled, you will receive the [SEPA Instant Outbound Payment Settled webhook](#sepa-instant-outbound-payment-settled-webhook) and the [Customer Accounts Transaction Completed webhook](#customer-accounts-transaction-completed-webhook).

#### Cancellation reason codes

Outbound payments may be cancelled due to **internal validation failure** (the payment did not pass our internal validation rules) or **external validation failure** (the payment did not pass SEPA scheme or beneficiary bank validation rules). Cancelled payments return a reason code which is reflected in the `CancellationCode` field of the [SEPA Instant Outbound Payment Cancelled webhook](#sepa-instant-outbound-payment-cancelled-webhook). The cancellation codes include, but are not limited to:

| Reason code | Description                                                           | Internal validation failure | External validation failure |

## Receive an SCT Inst payment

Receipt of an SCT Inst payment can be confirmed by subscribing to the [SEPA Instant Inbound Payment Settled webhook](#sepa-instant-inbound-payment-settled-webhook).

<WebhookPlaceholder render='sepa-instant-inbound-payment-settled-v1' />

## Request an SCT Inst recall

### Send a recall request

You can send SCT Inst recall requests using the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant/{paymentId}/recall](#recall-an-sct-inst-payment) endpoint. You will receive confirmation via the [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Created webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-created-webhook), and a response via either the [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Settled](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-settled-webhook) or [SEPA Instant Recall Request Rejected](#sepa-instant-recall-request-rejected-webhook) webhooks. 

Recall requests remain valid for a maximum of **15 business days**.  If after 15 business days the receiving party has not responded, the recall request is automatically rejected and the [SEPA Instant Recall Request Rejected webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-request-rejected-webhook) is sent.

![A message flow diagram explaining a rejected SCT Inst recall which results in receiving a SEPA Instant Recall Request Rejected webhook](/assets/images/sct-inst-rejected-recall.svg)

If the receiving party rejects the recall request, a rejection code will be provided and populated in the `RejectionCode` field of the [SEPA Instant Recall Request Rejected webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-request-rejected-webhook). The recall rejection codes include, but are not limited to:

| Reason Code | Description                                                  |

## Receive and respond to a recall request

If you receive a recall request, you will be notified via the [SEPA Instant Recall Request Received webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-request-received-webhook). You can review the details of the request by referring to the `OriginalTransactionId` for details of the original payment received and `ReasonCode` for the reason the sending party is requesting the recall (see [Recall reason codes](#recall-reason-codes))

To respond to the recall request, use the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant/{paymentId}/recall-response](#respond-to-an-sct-inst-recall-request) endpoint. Set the `approve` boolean `true` to accept the request or `false` to reject it.

<Callout colour="blue">
If `approve` is set to `true`, a pacs.004 payment will be automatically initiated. You do not need to initiate a payment.
If `approve` is set to `false`, the `rejectionCode` field must be populated with a rejection reason code.
</Callout>

Following your approval of a recall request, the amount of the original payment is ring-fenced and returned to the sending party. You can be notified of the status of the status of the return payment via the [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Created webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-created-webhook), [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Settled webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-settled-webhook), and [SEPA Instant Recall Payment Cancelled webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-cancelled-webhook).

Recall requests should be responded to within 15 business days. If after 15 business days you do not accept or reject the recall, ClearBank will automatically reject the request.

The following diagram outlines the process following the unlikely event that there is an issue with the pacs.004 payment that is sent following your approval of an inbound recall request.

![A message flow diagram explaining responding to a recall request with 'approve' followed by the pacs.004 payment being rejected at RT1 resulting in receiving a SEPA Instant Recall Payment Cancelled webhook](/assets/images/sct-inst-recall-payment-cancelled.svg)

Following a rejected pacs.004 and receipt of the SEPA Instant Recall Payment Cancelled webhook, the ring-fence is removed from the recall amount and you must re-initiate the recall response using the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant/{paymentId}/recall-response](#respond-to-an-sct-inst-recall-request) endpoint.

## Simulate SCT Inst payment scenarios

### Simulate a delayed outbound SCT Inst payment

To test the SEPA Instant Outbound Payment Delayed webhook, you can provide one of the following values in the `reference` field of a Send SCT Inst Payment request:

| Reference field value      | Simulated behavior                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--DelayPayment--`         | Delays the payment by 10 seconds, then proceeds as normal - validation still applies.     |
| `--CancelDelayedPayment--` | Delays the payment by 10 seconds, then cancels the payment with cancellation code `CB05`. |


<Callout colour="blue">
  When a payment is delayed and then settles, it will settle under a new TransactionId for regulatory reasons. You can instead use the PaymentId for an identifier that remains unchanged throughout the payment's lifecycle.
