## Recall a SEPA Instant CT payment

### Send a recall request

You can send SEPA Instant CT recall requests using the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant/{paymentId}/recall](#request-a-sepa-instant-recall) endpoint. You will receive confirmation via the [SEPA Instant CT Recall Payment Created webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-created-webhook), and a response via either the [Settled](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-settled-webhook), [Rejected](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-rejected-webhook), or [Cancelled](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-cancelled-webhook) webhooks. 

Recall requests remain valid for a maximimum of **15 business days**.  If after 15 business days the receiving party has not responded, the recall request is automatically rejected and the [SEPA Instant Recall Request Rejected webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-rejected-webhook) is sent.

### Recall reason codes

Recalls can be requested using the following reason codes:

| Reason | Description|Time limit to send recall request|
|------|-----------|---------------------------------|
|DUPL |Duplicate sending|10 buiness days| 
|TECH |Technical problems resulting in an erroneous SEPA Instant CT Transaction|10 buiness days|
|FRAD |Fraudulent originated SEPA Instant CT Instruction|13 months|
|AC03 |Wrong account number in original transfer|13 months|
|AM09 |Wrong amount in original transfer|13 months|
|CUST |Requested by customer|13 months|

## Receive and respond to a recall request

If you receive a recall request, you will be notified via the [SEPA Instant CT Recall Request Received webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-request-received-webhook). You can review the details of the request by referring to the `OriginalTransactionId` for details of the original payment receieved and `ReasonCode` for the reason the sending party is requesting the recall (see [Recall reason codes](#recall-reason-codes))

To respond to the recall request, use the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant/{paymentId}/recall-response](#respond-to-a-sepa-instant-recall-request) endpoint. Set the `approve` boolean `true` to accept the request or `false` to reject it.

<Callout colour="blue">
If `approve` is set to `true`, a pacs.004 payment will be automatically initiated. You do not need to initiate a payment.
If `approve` is set to `false`, the `rejectionCode` field must be populated with a rejection reason code.
</Callout>

Following your approval of a recall request, the amount of the original payment is ringfenced and returned to the sending party. You can be notified of the status of the status of the return payment via the [SEPA Instant CT Recall Payment Created webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-created-webhook), [SEPA Instant CT Recall Payment Settled webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-settled-webhook) and [SEPA Instant CT Recall Payment Cancelled webhook](#sepa-instant-recall-payment-cancelled-webhook).

Recall requests should be responded to within 15 business days. If after 15 business days you do not accept or reject the recall, ClearBank will automatically reject the request.

The following diagram outlines the process following the unlikely event that there is an issue with the pacs.004 payment that is sent following your approval of an inbound recall request.

![A message flow diagram explaining responding to a recall request with 'approve' followed by the pacs.004 payment being rejected at RT1 resulting in receiving a SEPA Instant CT Recall Payment Cancelled webhook](/assets/images/sepa-ict-recall-payment-cancelled.svg)

Following a rejected pacs.004 and receipt of the SEPA Instant CT Recall Payment Cancelled webhook, the ringfence is removed from the recall amount and you must re-initiate the recall response using the [POST /v1/payments/sepa-instant/{paymentId}/recall-response](#respond-to-a-sepa-instant-ct-recall-request) endpoint.
