> You will be notified of incoming SCT payments via the [SEPA CT Inbound Payment Completed](#sepa-ct-inbound-payment-completed-webhook) webhook.

### Opening hours

Inbound SCT payments can be received on Netherlands business days between 02:30 and 16:30 CET.

Outbound SCT payments can be sent on Netherlands business days between 07:00 and 16:00 CET. Transactions submitted after 16:00 or on bank holidays or weekends will be rejected. If a payment is submitted before the cut-off point but cannot be submitted to scheme, it will be placed in a queue until outbound payments reopen.

## Returning SCT payments

SCT payments can also be returned to the payment originator.

You can return a payment using the [POST /payments/sepa-ct/v1/payment-returns](#return-an-sct-payment) endpoint. You can only return a payment after receiving the [SEPA CT Inbound Payment Completed webhook](#sepa-ct-inbound-payment-completed-webhook). Returns must be sent within three business days of the original payment's settlement date.

![A message flow diagram explaining how to send an SCT return](/assets/images/sepa-ct-return.svg)

Once the return has been processed, you will either receive the [SEPA CT Inbound Payment Return Completed](#sepa-ct-inbound-payment-return-completed-webhook) and [Customer Accounts Transaction Completed](#customer-accounts-transaction-completed-webhook) webhooks or the [SEPA CT Inbound Payment Return Failed](#sepa-ct-inbound-payment-return-failed-webhook) webhook.

    {
      path: "/payments/sepa-ct/v1/payment-returns",
      version: "1.0-SEPA-CT",
      webhooks: [
        'sepa-ct-inbound-payment-return-completed-v1',
        'sepa-ct-inbound-payment-return-failed-v1',
        'eu-customer-accounts-transaction-completed-v1'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

<WebhookPlaceholder render='sepa-ct-inbound-payment-return-completed-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='sepa-ct-inbound-payment-return-failed-v1' />

## Receive a returned SCT payment

You will be notified of a successful SCT return payment via the [SEPA CT Outbound Payment Return Completed webhook](#sepa-ct-outbound-payment-return-completed-webhook).

<WebhookPlaceholder render='sepa-ct-outbound-payment-return-completed-v1' />

## Simulate SCT payment scenarios

The following will allow you to test SCT payment scenarios in the ClearBank simulation environment.

<EndpointBlock
  type="post"
  title="Simulate an inbound SCT payment"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/v1/payments/sepa-ct/emulator/inbound/payment",
      version: "1.0-SEPA-CT-Emulator",
            webhooks: [
        'sepa-ct-outbound-payment-completed-v1',
        'eu-customer-accounts-transaction-completed-v1'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

### Simulate a returned SCT payment

To simulate the return of an SCT payment in the simulation environment, use the [Send an SCT payment](#send-an-sct-outbound-payment) endpoint with the `remittanceInformationUnstructured` field populated with `--SCTRETURN--`. This will simulate an outbound SCT payment settling and then being returned by the creditor.

 Receipt of the [SEPA CT Outbound Payment Return Completed webhook](#sepa-ct-outbound-payment-return-completed-webhook) confirms the return payment.

```
"remittanceInformationUnstructured": "--SCTRETURN--"
```
