## Verification of Payee

Verification of Payee (VoP) is a service designed to help users avoid making payments to the wrong person, mitigating fraud and increasing confidence in payments. 

You can call our VoP endpoint to check an intended payee's name matches the name held against the payee account. The VoP service will indicate if the details match, and if so, whether there is a full or partial match.  

<Callout colour="blue">
  From October 2025, you should conduct VoP before making any SCT Inst or SEPA CT payments under European Payment Council rules.
</Callout>

For example, if the remitter intends to pay 'Maria Green', but the account belongs to 'John Taylor', our VoP endpoint will return `NMTC` - 'No match'.
