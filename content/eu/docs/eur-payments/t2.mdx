## T2

T2, formerly known as TARGET2, is the Real Time Gross Settlement payment scheme for euro payments. It uses ISO 20022 message formats.

T2 has no transaction limit, making it suitable for high-value payments. Transactions are processed in euros using central bank money. When you submit a payment, we send a settlement request to the RTGS system. This processes the request and, upon approval, debits ClearBank and credits the recipient bank. It also sends a settlement confirmation.

### Payment types

**Customer payments** (pacs.008) are payments that have either your or another financial institution's (FI) customer as the ultimate debtor or creditor.


**Institution payments** (pacs.009) are exclusively for FI to FI payments. If you attempt to send an institution payment to an end-user account, the payment will be returned. However, you'll still be charged a processing fee for the payment.

**Return payments** (pacs.004) are payments returned to either your customer or a financial institution.

<Callout colour="blue">
You'll need to subscribe to the <a href="#t-2-payment-return-inbound-completed-webhook">T2 Payment Return Inbound Completed webhook</a> to be notified of returned payments.
</Callout>

There are three endpoints you can use to submit or return T2 payments:

| Endpoint     | Purpose      | Completed webhook          | Failed webhook    |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **[/payments/t2-rtgs/v1/customer-payments](#send-a-t-2-payment)** | Send a T2 payment (pacs.008) | [T2 Customer Credit Transfer Outbound Completed webhook](#t-2-customer-credit-transfer-outbound-completed-webhook)| [T2 Customer Credit Transfer Outbound Failed webhook](#t-2-customer-credit-transfer-outbound-failed-webhook)|
| **[/payments/t2-rtgs/v1/payment-returns](#send-a-t-2-payment-to-an-institution)** | Return a T2 payment (pacs.004) | [T2 Payment Return Outbound Completed webhook](#t-2-payment-return-outbound-completed-webhook)| [T2  Payment Return Outbound Failed webhook](#t-2-payment-return-outbound-failed-webhook)|
| **[/payments/t2-rtgs/v1/institution-payments](#send-a-t-2-payment-to-an-institution)** | Send a T2 payment to an institution (pacs.009) | [T2 Financial Institution Outbound Credit Transfer Completed webhook](#t-2-financial-institution-credit-transfer-outbound-completed-webhook)| [T2 Financial Institution Outbound Credit Transfer Failed webhook](#t-2-financial-institution-credit-transfer-outbound-failed-webhook)|

## Receiving T2 payments

When an inbound T2 payment is received, you'll be notified with one of the below webhooks depending on the payment type.

For institution payments (pacs.009), the T2 scheme does not require IBANs to be provided. **We direct any inbound institution payments addressed only to a BIC and not with an IBAN to your** [**Primary Operating Account**](../accounts/account-types) (this is the first Operating Account created).

## T2 simulation endpoints

These endpoints can be used to simulate payments. You can also use them for automated testing.

- Simulate an inbound T2 payment (pacs.008) through the [POST /payments/t2-rtgs/v1/inbound/customer-payments](#simulate-a-t-2-payment) endpoint.
- Simulate a returned T2 payment (pacs.004) through the [POST /payments/t2-rtgs/v1/inbound/payment-returns](#simulate-a-return-t-2-payment) endpoint.
- Simulate a T2 bank-to-bank payment (pacs.009) through the [POST /payments/t2-rtgs/v1/inbound/institution-payments](#simulate-a-t-2-bank-to-bank-payment) endpoint.
