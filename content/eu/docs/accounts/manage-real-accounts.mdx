A real account held with ClearBank and can be used to send and/or receive payments. The balance of a real account is also held by ClearBank.

**Before creating an account, please ensure that you know which [account type](./account-types) you need to create.** If you are unsure, please get in touch.

<Callout colour="blue">
At this time, you can only hold euro (EUR) balances in a european real account. When you create the account, set <strong>currencies</strong> to <strong>EUR</strong>.
</Callout>

GBP payments to and from a european account are not allowed and would be rejected and returned automatically. For more information about currencies supported by ClearBank accounts, please speak to your Relationship Manager.
