## Account types

There are several types of accounts that can be created. Which you should use will depend on your agreement with ClearBank, and the purpose of the account.

When you join ClearBank you are given these three accounts by default:

- Your **institution master account** is not an account of its own; it is a superset of all your other accounts. 
- Your **repair suspense account** is an account used to apply funds relating to your institution which cannot be applied to the intended creditor account. Funds held in this account should be re-routed to the correct account or sent back by you.
- Your **operating account** holds your own operational funds.

You will need to create a **designated segregation account** and/or a **general segregation account** to hold customers' funds that need to be safeguarded. You can also create additional operational and safeguarding accounts as needed. You can create virtual accounts within a general segregation account in order to manage multiple customer's funds in one real account. Note that a segregation account should not be used to hold any of your own funds.

It is important to **select the correct usage for the account when you create it, as this cannot be amended later**. The account usage determines, for example, whether the account can be used for safeguarding funds.

When you create a real account use the `Kind` field to select `YourFunds`, `DesignatedSegregated`, or `GeneralSegregated`. 

The `Kind` value determines the autogenerated prefix assigned to the account, for example, 'Gen Seg Acc Retl'. The prefixes for each account are shown in the figure above.

To create and manage accounts, refer to:
- [Manage real accounts](./manage-real-accounts)
- [Manage virtual accounts](./manage-virtual-accounts)
