## Get connected

Before you can integrate with our API, you need to have been onboarded by us as a customer and have a valid authentication profile set up.
This authentication profile includes your Digital Certificate and secure API token. The API token needs to be included in the header of all REST API calls.

| Environment | ClearBank Portal URL                     | What you need for access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Create your authentication profile

Your ClearBank authentication profile links your institution to your public key. Therefore, it must be valid.

Your authentication profile is a combination of:

- A key pair (public/private)
- A certificate signing request (CSR) in PKCS #10 format*
- A token


*In the simulation environment, a CSR can be generated using open source solutions. In the production environment, a CSR must be generated using a FIPS 140-2 level 2 compliant hardware security module (HSM) such as Azure KV HSM, Amazon CloudHSM, GoogleCloudHSM (this is not an exhaustive list).

**To create a valid authentication profile:**

1. Generate your public key and private key pair in PKCS #8 format.
> In the simulation environment, you can utilise open source tools to store your private key. In the production environment, you must use a physical or virtual HSM solution to store your private key (see HSM requirements above).

2. Generate your certificate signing request (CSR) in PKCS #10 format which contains your certificate and public key.
3. Save your CSR as a .csr file.
4. Sign in to the ClearBank Portal using the URL from the table above.
5. From the menu, select **Institution > Certificates and Tokens**.
6. Select **Generate API Token**.
> ![alt text](/assets/images/GenerateToken_1.png "Certificates and Tokens page")

7. Upload your certificate signing request (.CSR) file.
8. Enter the **Token Name** and select an **Expiry Date**.
9. Select **Generate** to generate your token.
>> Your token will appear in the View Token window:
>> ![alt text](/assets/images/GenerateToken_2.png "Generate API tokens")
>> - The maximum token validity length is a year from the date of creation. You can set a shorter validity period if required.
>> - You will only be able to view your token once: at the time of creation.
>> - You can copy the token directly or copy it to your clipboard using the button provided.
>> - Ensure that you store your token securely now. Otherwise, you will need to generate a new one.
>> ![alt text](/assets/images/GenerateToken_3.png "View Tokens")

Congratulations! You have successfully created your authentication profile.

### Create your digital signature

We use a digital signature to ensure that the integrity of a request body (sent to us) is maintained. The whole HTTP request body (in its original format) is used to create a digital signature, as it is specific to the body of each request.

We use the following specifications to create a digital signature:
- Raw message encoding: UTF-8
- Message digest algorithm: SHA-256
- Signing algorithm: RSA
- Padding: PKCS#1 v1.5
- Digital signature encoding: Base64

**To create a digital signature for POST, PUT, and PATCH requests:**

1. UTF-8 encode the exact request body that will be sent to our API (any differences including the addition or removal of spaces will result in a totally different digital signature)
2. Hash the encoded value using SHA-256
3. Request a digital signature for that hash value from your hardware security module (HSM)
> (In the simulation environment, this can be done using open source solutions.)

4. The output is the message digital signature
5. Send the Base64 encoded string representation of the digital signature in the HTTP header **DigitalSignature** for all requests that have a request body (POST, PUT, and PATCH)

**To create a digital signature for GET and DELETE requests:**

1. UTF-8 encode the value generated by concatenating your `HTTP METHOD`, `Query Path`, `X-Request-Id`, and `X-Request-Time` values
2. Hash the encoded value using SHA-256
3. Request a digital signature for that hash value from your hardware security module (HSM)
> (In the simulation environment, this can be done using open source solutions.)

4. The output is the message digital signature
5. Send the Base64 encoded string representation of the digital signature in the HTTP header **DigitalSignature** for all GET and DELETE requests

For additional help with creating your authentication profile and digital signature, please refer to the following examples on the ClearBank GitHub repository:
- <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/clearbank/fi-api-101">C# example for ClearBank API and Webhooks</ExternalLink>
- <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/clearbank/fi-api-postman">Postman Collections for invoking the ClearBank API</ExternalLink>

- <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/clearbank/fi-api-signtool-python">Python example for signing ClearBank API requests</ExternalLink>
- <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/clearbank/fi-api-signtool-java">Java example for signing ClearBank API requests</ExternalLink>

Please note that the code in these examples is not production ready and has been simplified for brevity.

## Use endpoints

Once you have set up your connection to our simulation environment, you are ready to send requests using our API endpoints. The information here allows you to use the GET /v1/Test and POST /v1/Test endpoints.

### Header parameters

We utilise HTTP-request headers for our API calls which include `Authorization`, `DigitalSignature`, `X-Request-Id`, and `X-Request-Time` headers. In all our responses we will send an `X-Correlation-Id` in the header, together with an [HTTP status code](#http-status-codes).

Different request types require different headers as shown in this table:

| Request method/Response | Header parameters                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET, DELETE             | Authorization, DigitalSignature, X-Request-Id, X-Request-Time |
| POST, PATCH, PUT        | Authorization, DigitalSignature, X-Request-Id                 |
| Response                | X-Correlation-Id                                              |

Here are the details of each parameter:

import ParameterDetails from 'src/components/parameter-details'
import parametersEu from '../../../eu/docs/api/parameters'

<ParameterDetails parameter={parametersEu.authorizationEu} />
<ParameterDetails parameter={parametersEu.digitalSignatureEu} />
<ParameterDetails parameter={parametersEu.xRequestIdEu} />
<ParameterDetails parameter={parametersEu.xRequestTimeEu} />
<ParameterDetails parameter={parametersEu.xCorrelationIdEu} />

### Authenticate your API calls

We use your API token to authenticate your requests and allow you to securely access protected resources.

The base URL for your environment is either:
- Simulation `https://institution-api-sim.eu.clearbank.io/`
- Production `https://institution-api.eu.clearbank.io/ `

Your API token should be included in your HTTP `Authorization` header. Please refer to [Header parameters](#header-parameters) for more information.

This example request shows the API token in the `Authorization` , `DigitalSignature` and `X-Request-Id` header.

``` json
curl -v -POST https://institution-api-sim.eu.clearbank.io/v1/Test \
  -H “Authorization: Bearer <<your api token>>”
  -H “DigitalSignature: <<digitalsignature>>”
  -H “X-Request-Id: <<X-request-ID>>”      
  -d ‘{ "body": "hello world!" }’      
```

The response shows results from the test call
``` json
{
	"Message": "hello world!"
}
```

To confirm that authentication and signature verification are working as expected, when you send a POST/v1/Test request you will receive a `FITestEvent webhook` from ClearBank (if you are subscribed to it).
We use webhooks to deliver transaction confirmation notifications and account-specific reconciliations to your system as soon as such events occur on your account. Please refer to [Set up and test webhook listener URLs](#set-up-and-test-webhook-listener-urls) for more information.

<EndpointBlock
  type="get"
  title="GET Test endpoint"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/v1/Test",
      version: "1.0",
      title: "GET Test endpoint",
    }
  ]}
/>

<EndpointBlock
  type="post"
  title="POST Test endpoint"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/v1/Test",
      version: "1.0",
      title: "POST Test endpoint",
    }
  ]}
/>

### Query parameters

For most of our `GET` requests, one or more query parameters in the request URL can be used to specify the number of returned results and the number of pages returned.

| Parameter    | Type | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pageNumber` | int  | The page number to control returned results into manageable sets. Default if not supplied: 1 `pageNumber=1` |
| `pageSize`   | int  | The page size to control returned results into manageable sets. Default if not supplied: 50 `pageSize=50`   |

### HTTP status codes

When you send a request, the response will include a HTTP status code to indicate the success or failure of the request. Some endpoints return JSON response bodies that include errors and additional properties.

| Status code | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200`       | **OK** - The request has succeeded.                                                                                                                                     |
| `201`       | **Created** - The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result.                                                                                |
| `202`       | **Accepted** - The request has been received but not completed yet. Indicates that the request will be completed asynchronously.                                        |
| `204`       | **No content** - The request has been fulfilled but we do not need to return a response body. We may return the updated meta information.                               |
| `400`       | **Bad request** - The request could not be understood or processed. The response should include the reason why the request has failed.                                  |
| `401`       | **Unauthorised** - The request was not authorised due to missing or invalid credentials.                                                                                |
| `403`       | **Forbidden** - Unable to perform the request as the provided credentials could not be verified.                                                                        |
| `404`       | **Not found** - The resource you are looking for cannot be found.                                                                                                       |
| `405`       | **Method not allowed** - The request is recognised but the target resource does not support this method.                                                                |
| `406`       | **Not acceptable** - The `Accept` header in the request is not supported.                                                                                               |
| `409`       | **Conflict** - The request conflicts with the current state of the server.                                                                                              |
| `410`       | **Gone** - The requested resource is no longer available, likely due to deprecation.                                                                                    |
| `415`       | **Unsupported media type** - The `Content-Type` of the request is not supported. No match for a key in the requestBody content map.                                     |
| `422`       | **Client error** - The request cannot be processed due to failure processing payload. The payload may be valid but the data within the request could not be acted upon. |
| `423`       | **Locked** - The resource that is being accessed is locked.                                                                                                             |
| `429`       | **Too many requests** - You have sent too many requests in a given time (see [Rate limiting](#rate-limiting))                                                           |
| `500`       | **Internal server error**                                                                                                                                               |
| `503`       | **Server error** - Service unavailable.                                                                                                                                 |

#### 2XX status codes
Responses with a `2XX` status code indicate the request was successfully received and verified. The status code will indicate if the request has been completed or is due to be completed shortly (asynchronously).

#### 4XX status codes
Responses with a `4XX` status code indicate the request was received but was unable to be actioned, details of the error can be found in the `title` field of the response in a human readable format. 4XX errors are typically caused by an issue with the request (for example, incorrect formatting or missing data) or issues validating the request (for example, missing or invalid credentials). Due to the wide variety scenarios, we are unable to list every potential variation of error, however, the combination of status code and `title` should allow you to identify and resolve the issue.

#### Common 4XX responses
See the below examples of some common 4XX responses and their meaning which may assist you in troubleshooting.

**Missing X-Request-Id**

```json
"type": "about:blank",
"title": "Missing X-Request-Id Header"
"status": 400
```

**Duplicated X-Request-Id**

```json
"status": 409
```

**Invalid token**

```json
"status": 403
```

**Invalid Digital Signature**

```json
"type": "about:blank",
"title": "Invalid DigitalSignature Header"
"status": 400
```

#### 5xx status codes
Responses with a `5XX` status code indicate a service error. If received, you should retry your request with exactly the same X-Request-Id header and payload to prevent duplication. In exceptional circumstances where the initial request was effectively processesed, the second request would make that clear either in the response or via an appropriate webhook. In the event this response is caused by a planned or unexpected system outage on our part, we will communicate this via email.

#### Example of a response containing detailed errors

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "additionalProp1": [
      "string"
    ],
    "additionalProp2": [
      "string"
    ],
    "additionalProp3": [
      "string"
    ]
  },
  "type": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "status": 0,
  "detail": "string",
  "instance": "string"
}
```
### Rate limiting
We use rate limiting to protect our systems from excessive load and to ensure a consistent level of availability and performance to all our clients.

<Callout colour="blue">
Our rate limits are dynamic and are therefore subject to change over time. This means you should implement your systems to be able to handle rate limits and react accordingly. 
</Callout>

Rate limits result in a `429` status code response from our platform. Upon receipt of a `429` you should reasonably back off and try and again later. All requests are safe to retry after a short period of time. To aid with the testing of this our rate limits are significantly lower in our simulation environment. This should make it easier to hit the limit and validate that your systems behave accordingly.

### HAL Links

We use HAL (Hypertext Application Language) to hyperlink between resources in our API.

Each HAL hyperlink contains:

| Parameter   | Type      | Required | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | `string`  | Required | The named link type                                                                                                       |
| `href`      | `string`  | Required | URI to be used                                                                                                            |
| `templated` | `boolean` |          | Specified as `true` if href is a URI template, i.e. with parameters. Otherwise, this property is absent or set to `false` |

### Regular expressions

At ClearBank, we use Javascript formatted regular expressions in our endpoint fields. If you're using a language other than Javascript, some characters in the regular expression patterns we provide may need to be escaped.

It is your responsibility to find details of the regular expression characters permitted by your programming language. We cannot provide regular expressions in other languages.

## Use webhooks

### What are webhooks?

When certain events occur, we generate and send out a webhook message to your defined URL. You can subscribe to the webhooks you wish to receive as described in [Set up and test webhook listener URLs](#set-up-and-test-webhook-listener-urls). When you receive a webhook, you will need to respond to it to confirm receipt.

All ClearBank webhooks consist of a `DigitalSignature`, `Type`, `Version`, `Payload`, and `Nonce`. Payload parameters vary depending on the webhook.

Webhooks are asynchronous events and can be delivered in any order. We provide at-least-once delivery of webhooks. Because webhooks may be sent more than once, your webhook handlers must be idempotent. You can check for duplicates based on the payload of the webhook.

#### Webhook structure

| Element            | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DigitalSignature` | string | ClearBank's Digital Signature                                                                                                                                           |
| `Type`             | string | The type of the event                                                                                                                                                   |

| `Nonce`            | int    | Cryptographically secure number generated by ClearBank for every single webhook. A nonce number is generated randomly and should not be used as a check for duplication |
| `Payload`          | object | Object which contains information related to the webhook                                                                                                                |

#### Response structure
Webhook responses contain a `200` HTTP status code which includes a `Nonce` number in the body and your `DigitalSignature`.

| Element            | Type   | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DigitalSignature` | string | Signed hash of the body of the request. The hash is signed by your private key. |

| `200`              | int    | HTTP response status code                                                       |

### IP address ranges

The ranges of IP addresses that ClearBank webhooks are sent from are different for the simulation and production environments. All the IP addresses listed here should be included on your allow list so that webhooks are not blocked by your security.

The ranges of public IP addresses to support your interaction with ClearBank webhooks are:
- Simulation public IP address ranges: `20.238.170.48/28`, `20.56.46.192/28`, `68.219.189.112/28`, `98.71.253.192/28`
- Production public IP address ranges: `20.238.170.32/28`, `74.234.245.96/28`, `74.234.134.48/28`, `108.143.197.128/28`

This list was last updated on 24 August 2023.

### Handling a webhook

Webhooks sent by ClearBank include the security components needed for you to verify the authenticity of the data they contain. It is important that you use these to verify each webhook was sent by ClearBank. Subsequently, ClearBank verifies that you have successfully received the webhook (based on your response acknowledging receipt).

The handling of a webhook can be thought of in three different parts: **verification, response, and processing**.

#### Verification

You need to verify that ClearBank is the true source of the webhook, and that the webhook has not been tampered with.

**To verify the integrity of the webhook received from ClearBank:**
1. In the ClearBank Portal, on the Webhook Management page, select **Download Public Key**.
>> This provides a public key specific to your institution.
2. Hash the request body using SHA 256.
3. Convert the `DigitalSignature` request header value from a Base64 encoded string into the byte array.
4. Verify the signature using the RSA algorithm.

We have provided an example C# controller in the <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/clearbank/fi-api-101">ClearBank fi-api-101 Github Repository</ExternalLink> which shows how to calculate the hash value and verify the digital signature. Once you know the webhook can be trusted, you can respond.

#### Response

**If you were able to successfully verify** that ClearBank was the true source of the webhook then you must return a `200` HTTP response. This must include the nonce number in the response body and be signed with a valid digital signature. (If your response is invalid, we will consider the webhook to have failed.)

**If you are not able to verify** the webhook source then you should respond with a reasonable status code/error code to signify that the webhook should be treated as failed.

<Callout colour="blue">
  A webhook response must be sent in less than 5 seconds. Any response received more than 5 seconds after the webhook was sent is ignored, and the webhook will be considered to have failed.
</Callout>

We will retry webhooks that we are not able to consider successful every 15 minutes for 24 hours or until you return a successful response. We err on the side of caution to ensure you have correctly received the webhook. For more information, refer to [Idempotency](#idempotency).

**To create the webhook digital signature:**
1. Take the nonce number from the webhook and place it in the body of the response (like this: `{"nonce": <value>}`).
2. Hash the response body using SHA 256.
3. Sign the hash with your private key and attach the signed hash as a Base64 encoded string in the `DigitalSignature` response header.

> Your private key needs to correspond to a public key which has been used to create a certificate signing request (CSR). Please refer to [create your authentication profile](#create-your-authentication-profile) for more information.

##### Example HTTP request:
```
POST http://yourdomain.com/sample/webhook HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 72
Digitalsignature: YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
X-Request-Id: f0309d95-4f68-4ecd-9c8d-b2d08d9fedd8

{"Type":"FITestEvent","Version":1,"Payload":"test me","Nonce":1448545215}
```

##### Example HTTP response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Digitalsignature: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"Nonce": 1448545215
}
```

#### Processing

Due to the 5 second timeout window that applies to successful webhook responses, it makes sense to minimise the processing that is done before responding to the webhook. We recommend verifying, queuing, and responding to the webhook synchronously. An internal queuing solution can then handle any further processing asynchronously (including any checks for duplicates).

#### Idempotency

We use at-least-once delivery when sending webhooks. This means to ensure you have received a webhook, we may send it to you multiple times.

Duplicate webhooks can generally be identified by looking at the EventType, Timestamp and Id within the payload. If the values are the same, the webhook is a duplicate.

You must be able to handle duplicate webhooks idempotently. This means you should always respond in the appropriate format even if you have detected a duplicated or retried webhook. If you don't, we won't be able to verify the webhook was successfully received and will therefore retry delivery.

### Set up and test webhook listener URLs

You can create one webhook listener for all events or separate webhook listeners for specific events.
In this example, you will setup an `FITestEvent` webhook URL, which you can test against the [`TEST POST` endpoint](#post-test-endpoint).

To manage your webhook definitions and set your webhook listener URLs for each event:
1. Sign in to the ClearBank Portal. More information about accessing the portal can be found [here](#get-connected).
2. From the menu, select **Institution** > **Webhook Management**.
>> ![alt text](/assets/images/webhook-management-page.png "Webhook management page")
3. Search for **Test webhook** and select **Edit**.
4. Enter the **URL** you want to define as your webhook listener for this webhook and set the webhook status to **Enabled**.
5. Select **Save**.
6. To test the webhook, select **Test button**.
7. Enter a test message in the Test webhook window for example, ‘Hello World’ and select **Send**.
>> You should receive an `FITestEvent webhook` to your nominated URL containing the test message in the body.

**You must not include any sensitive information (such as API keys) in your webhook URLs.**
