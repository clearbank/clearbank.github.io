## Our API

<Callout colour="green"><h2>Our API for Europe is coming soon</h2><p>All information on this page describes a solution that is <strong>not yet live in production and therefore could change</strong>. This includes any endpoint and webhook details. The information is being provided early to aid you in integrating with our API in our European simulation environment.</p>
</Callout>

The ClearBank API for Europe is a JSON RESTful API which allows you to interact with our Accounts and Clearing products. [Webhooks](./getting-started#use-webhooks) are used to deliver asynchronous event notifications such as transaction confirmations and account-specific reconciliations as they occur.

The ClearBank API is available for consumption by financial institutions, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulated businesses, and fintech companies which have been onboarded with ClearBank.

If you would like to connect with ClearBank's API, please [apply here](https://clear.bank/eligibility-criteria).

## Building your system

To create a working system, you will need to sign in and authenticate, be able to create and manage accounts, make transactions, and support reconciliation and reporting.

Once built, the validation steps are:

1. You test your connectivity and interaction with our full suite of endpoints and webhooks in a simulation environment (sandbox).
2. We take you through a QA process to confirm successful integration.
3. As the last step, you will be promoted to use the API in a live production environment.
