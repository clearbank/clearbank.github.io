## Versioning

<Callout colour="green"><h2>Our API for Europe is coming soon</h2><p>All information on this page describes a solution that is <strong>not yet live in production and therefore could change</strong>. This includes any endpoint and webhook details. The information is being provided early to aid you in integrating with our API in our European simulation environment.</p>
</Callout>

Providing developers with a seamless integration experience is at the core of our API versioning approach. We work in an agile environment and iteratively release the latest versions of individual endpoints and webhooks.

We follow the Semantic Versioning specification (https://semver.org/):

- Internally, we update minor and patch versions whenever we add optional functionality and backwards compatible changes.
- Whenever we introduce a breaking change, we will provision a new major version of the API.

All API endpoints are versioned through the URI path; for example, /v2/Accounts. Endpoint details can be found on the Developer Portal.

A backwards compatible change does not affect existing integrations for tolerant readers, for example the addition of new optional fields for an API request, response or a webhook payload. A breaking change could affect existing integrations, for example the addition of a new mandatory field or removal of an existing field.
