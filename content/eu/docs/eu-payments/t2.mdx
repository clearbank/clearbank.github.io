## T2

<Callout colour="green"><h2>T2 is coming soon</h2><p>All information on this page describes a solution that is <strong>not yet live in production and therefore could change</strong>. This includes any endpoint and webhook details. The information is being provided early to aid you in integrating with our API in our European simulation environment.</p>

T2, formerly known as Target2, is the Real Time Gross Settlement payment scheme for Euro payments. It uses ISO 20022 message formats.

T2 has no transaction limit, making it suitable for high-value payments. Transactions are processed in Euros using central bank money. When you submit a payment, we send a settlement request to the RTGS system. This processes the request and, upon approval, debits ClearBank and credits the recipient bank. It also sends a settlement confirmation.

**Customer payments** are payments that have either your or another financial institution's customer as the ultimate debtor or creditor. **Institution payments** are exclusively financial institution to financial institution. **Return payments** can be returned to either your customer or a financial institution.

Institution (pacs.009) payments are only available to some of our clients. If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your relationship manager.

There are three endpoints you can use to submit or return T2 payments:

| Endpoint     | Purpose      | Completed webhook          | Failed webhook    |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **[/payments/t2-rtgs/v1/customer-payments](#send-a-t-2-payment)** | Send a T2 payment (pacs.008) | [T2 Customer Credit Transfer Outbound Completed webhook](#t-2-customer-credit-transfer-outbound-completed-webhook)| [T2 Customer Credit Transfer Outbound Failed webhook](#t-2-customer-credit-transfer-outbound-failed-webhook)|
| **[/payments/t2-rtgs/v1/payment-returns](#send-a-t-2-payment-to-an-institution)** | Return a T2 payment (pacs.004) | [T2 Payment Return Outbound Completed webhook](#t-2-payment-return-outbound-completed-webhook)| [T2  Payment Return Outbound Failed webhook](#t-2-payment-return-outbound-failed-webhook)|
| **[/payments/t2-rtgs/v1/institution-payments](#send-a-t-2-payment-to-an-institution)** | Send a T2 payment to an institution (pacs.009) | [T2 Financial Institution Outbound Credit Transfer Completed webhook](#t-2-financial-institution-credit-transfer-outbound-completed-webhook)| [T2 Financial Institution Outbound Credit Transfer Failed webhook](#t-2-financial-institution-credit-transfer-outbound-failed-webhook)|

- The [T2 Payment Return Inbound Completed webhook](#t-2-payment-return-inbound-completed-webhook) is for incoming returns
- The [T2 Financial Institution Inbound Transfer Completed webhook](#t-2-financial-institution-credit-transfer-inbound-completed-webhook) is for incoming payments from financial institutions
