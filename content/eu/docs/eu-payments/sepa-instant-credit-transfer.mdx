## SEPA Instant Credit Transfer

SEPA Instant Credit Transfers (SEPA ICT) is a payment scheme that enables customers to make and receive payments, up to a maximum value of â‚¬100,000 within a 10 second period. Payments can be sent at any time, including bank holidays and weekends.

<p>SEPA ICT is currently an optional scheme. New regulation means that by January 2025 all participants that offer SEPA CT must also offer SEPA ICT.</p>
<p>In the event that a payment is initiated and the beneficiary's bank does not yet participate in SEPA ICT, the payment will be rejected.</p>
</Callout>

You can:
- [send SEPA ICT payments](#sending-a-sepa-ict-payment)
- [recall SEPA ICT payments](#sepa-ict-recalls)

- receive SEPA ICT payments
> You are notified of incoming SEPA ICT payments via the [SEPA Instant Payment Settled webhook](#sepa-instant-payment-settled-webhook) and the [Customer Accounts Transaction Completed webhook](#customer-accounts-transaction-completed-webhook).
