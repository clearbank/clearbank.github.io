## FX trade (RFQ)

A Request for Quote (RFQ) in the context of foreign exchange (FX) will allow you to request a price up-front for any of our currently supported currency pairs and hold that rate for a set period. 

Once you receive the response with the quote, the rate is held for **45 seconds**. If you decide that you want to initiate the trade, a separate trade request must be submitted within the held rate period. This functionality enhances your trading capabilities by providing a transparent and efficient way to secure the held rates via ClearBank.

 This message flow diagram shows the flow of requesting a rate quote, successfully executing the trade within the held rate period, and the associated trade settled webhook.

![A message flow diagram detailing a successful quote request and quote execution. The customer uses the POST /fx/v1/quote endpoint to request an FX trade quote from ClearBank. ClearBank sends a 200 OK response which contains the quoted rate and a quoteId. The customer uses the POST /fx/v1/ExecuteQuote endpoint within the 45 second held rate period to execute the trade using the quoted amount. As the trade was executed within the held rate period, the customer receives a 202 Accepted response. This results in a successful trade, evidenced by the customer receiving an FX Trade Executed and FX Trade Settled webhook. This is the end of the message flow.](/assets/images/rfq-flow-diagram-success.svg "successful rfq trade message flow")

### Trade examples

You can use our FX trade functionality to perform FX trades between accounts which belong to the same owner. For example, let’s assume that you want to sell **GBP** from **Account A** to purchase **EUR** for **Account B** – in doing so, you will need to ensure that the owner of both accounts is the same. This applies to two accounts that belong to you, that is, the financial institution or your customers.

#### Example: Specifying the sell amount with margin

**Trade Request:**

- InstructedAmount: 1000
- FixedSide: Sell
- BuyCurrency:  USD
- SellCurrency: GBP (This means the fixed side of the trade is GBP and the floating side is USD. Therefore, the margin will be in USD).
- Margin: 0.01 (Where 0.01 represents a 1% margin)
- Assume the ClearBank rate is: 1.40 for GBP/USD
- Margin amount: 1.4 x 0.01 x GBP 1000 = USD 14

**Resulting transactions in respective accounts:**

- Debit to the sellAccount: GBP 1000.00
- Credit to the buyAccount: USD 1386 [USD 1.4 x (1-0.01) x 1000]
- Credit to the specified margin account: USD 14

#### Example: Specifying the buy amount with margin

**Trade Request:**

- InstructedAmount: 1400
- FixedSide: Buy
- BuyCurrency:  USD
- SellCurrency: GBP
- This means the fixed side of the trade is USD and the floating side is GBP, therefore the margin will be in GBP
- Margin: 0.01 (Where 0.01 represents a 1% margin)
- Assume the ClearBank rate is: 1.40 for GBP/USD
- Margin amount:  1400 / 1.4 x 0.01 = GBP 10

**Resulting transactions in respective accounts:**

- Debit to the sellAccount: GBP [1110 (1400 / 1.4 x (1 + 0.01)]
- Credit to the buyAccount: USD 1400
- Credit to the specified margin account: GBP  10

### FX trade cut-off times

 * If a trade is booked in time for same-day settlement, you will receive a webhook notification of the settlement. If it fails to settle (in practice, because there are insufficient funds in the account), you will learn of the failure immediately. ClearBank will then send a [fx-trade-cancelled-v1](../webhooks/#fx-trade-cancelled-webhook) webhook.

 * If a trade is booked, but cannot be settled until a later day, and the settlement fails, the [fx-trade-settlement-failed-v1](../webhooks/#fx-trade-settlement-failed-webhook) webhook notifies you of the failure. Make sure you subscribe to this webhook if you are making FX trades with a value (settlement) date later than the day of booking.
