## SEPA Credit Transfer UK

Our SEPA Credit Transfer UK (SCT UK) service lets you receive euro payments from any SEPA participant bank via the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) scheme. To get started with SCT UK, you'll need a euro account under a ClearBank UK BIC. This will be set up for you as part of your onboarding process.

If you're interested in using this new service, please contact your Client Director.

### Availability and hours

SCT UK is available Monday to Friday from 07:00 to 14:30 UK time, and is subject to scheme holidays.

The scheme holidays applicable to SCT UK are listed below:

* New Year's Day
* Good Friday
* Easter Monday
* Labour Day
* Christmas Day
* Boxing Day / Christmas Holiday

Exact dates can be found on <ExternalLink href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/contacts/working-hours/html/index.en.html">the ECB's website</ExternalLink>.

## Inbound payments

When you receive an SCT payment, you'll be notified via webhook. To receive webhooks, you'll need to [subscribe to them first](../api/getting-started#set-up-and-test-webhook-listener-urls) using the ClearBank Portal.

Our SCT UK service has two dedicated inbound payment webhooks:

* `Payments.CrossBorder.InboundPaymentCompleted` - **Cross-border Inbound Payment Completed webhook** - This webhook contains detailed ISO 20022 compliant payment information of any inbound SCT payments.
* `CustomerAccounts.TransactionCompleted` - **Customer Account Transaction Completed webhook** - This webhook contains the minimum information necessary to reconcile a payment.

> **Note:** if you are subscribed to our inbound Multi-Currency Payments service webhooks, `Payments.Mccy.TransactionCreated` and `Payments.Mccy.TransactionSettled`, these will also notify you of any inbound SCT payments. All of these webhooks' `TransactionId` field will have the same UUID whenever they refer to the same payment, so you can use this field in your idempotency logic to prevent double counting of inbound SCT payments.
