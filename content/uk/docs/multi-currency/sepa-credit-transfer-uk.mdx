The TARGET2 scheme holidays applicable to SCT UK are listed below:

* New Year's Day

Exact dates can be found on [the ECB's website](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/contacts/working-hours/html/index.en.html).

### Bulk payments

SCT UK supports bulk payments, which can be useful for making many simultaneous payments - for example, payroll. Each outbound payment request can include up to three debtor accounts, each of which can pay up to 100 different creditor accounts. It is therefore possible to request up to 300 payments at once.

Each payment request contains a nested structure of debtor accounts and their associated payments and creditor details. The outer array, `PaymentInformation`, contains entries for each debtor account. Within each debtor entry, the `CreditTransferTransactionInformation` array lists up to 100 individual payments to creditor accounts.
