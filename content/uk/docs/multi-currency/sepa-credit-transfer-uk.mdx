## SEPA Credit Transfer UK

<Callout colour="green">
  <h2>SEPA Credit Transfer UK (SCT UK) is coming soon</h2>
  <p>All information on this page describes a solution that is <strong>not yet live in production and therefore could change</strong>. This includes any endpoint and webhook details. The information is being provided early to aid you in integrating with our API in our UK simulation environment.</p>
</Callout>

Our SEPA Credit Transfer UK (SCT UK) service lets you exchange euro payments with any SEPA participant bank via the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) scheme. To get started with SCT UK, you'll need a euro account under a ClearBank UK BIC. This will be set up for you as part of your onboarding process.

<Callout colour="blue">
  You can only send euros inside the SEPA zone with SCT UK. To send euros outside of the SEPA zone, please refer to our <a href="/uk/docs/multi-currency/multi-currency-payments">multi-currency payments</a> service.
</Callout>

If you're interested in using this new service, please contact your Client Director.

### Availability and hours

SCT UK is available to use Monday to Friday from 06:00 to 14:30 UK time. Outbound payment requests made outside of these hours, on weekends, or during TARGET2 scheme holidays will be automatically rejected with a 422 Unprocessable Request error.

The TARGET2 scheme holidays applicable to SCT UK are listed below:

* New Year's Day
* Good Friday
* Easter Monday
* Labour Day
* Christmas Day
* Boxing Day

Exact dates can be found on <ExternalLink href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/contacts/working-hours/html/index.en.html">the ECB's website</ExternalLink>.

### Bulk payments

SCT UK supports bulk payments, which can be useful for making many simultaneous payments - such as payroll. Each outbound payment request can include up to three debtor accounts, each of which can pay up to 100 different creditor accounts. It is therefore possible to request up to 300 payments at once.

Each payment request contains a nested structure of debtor accounts and their associated payments and creditor details. The outer array, `PaymentInformation`, contains entries for each debtor account. Within each debtor entry, the `CreditTransferTransactionInformation` array lists up to 100 individual payments to creditor accounts.

![Diagram showing the PaymentInformation array, containing 3 debtors](/assets/images/sct-uk-bulk-payments-diagram.svg "")

When you send several payments at once in bulk, each payment is processed individually. This means if one payment fails, the remainder of the batch will be unaffected. You'll receive either an [SCT UK Outbound Payment Failed](#sct-uk-outbound-payment-failed-webhook), or an [SCT UK Outbound Payment Completed](#sct-uk-outbound-payment-completed-webhook) and an [SCT UK Customer Accounts Transaction Completed](#sct-uk-customer-accounts-transaction-completed-webhook) webhook for each payment in the batch, so you can keep track of their status.

### Example outbound payment request

You can use the below example request payload to test the **POST /payments/cross-border/v2/payments** endpoint.  
Take care to update the `RequestedExecutionDate` field to today's date, and to use a different `UETR` if using this example more than once.
