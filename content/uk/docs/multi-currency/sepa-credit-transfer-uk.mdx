Our SCT UK service lets you send and receive euro payments via SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT), enabling seamless euro transactions with any country in the SEPA network.

If you're interested in using this new service, please contact your Client Director.

### Availability and hours

SCT UK is only available on business days in the Netherlands. Payments submitted during Netherlands bank holidays or weekends will be rejected. Details of public holidays in the Netherlands are available from [the Dutch government's website](https://www.government.nl/topics/working-hours/question-and-answer/public-holidays-in-the-netherlands).

Inbound payments can be received between [02:30] and [16:30] CET, while outbound payments can be requested between [07:00] and [14:30 CET]. Payments requested outside of these hours will be rejected.

If a valid payment is requested before the cutoff time but cannot be submitted to scheme, it will be queued until scheme becomes available again.

### Bulk payments

SCT UK supports bulk payments, which can be useful for making many simultaneous payments - for example, payroll. Each payment request can include up to three debtor accounts, each of which can pay up to 100 different creditor accounts. It is therefore possible to request up to 300 payments at once.

Each payment request contains a nested structure of debtor accounts and their associated payments. The outer array, `PaymentInformation`, contains entries for each debtor account. Within each debtor entry, the `CreditTransferTransactionInformation` array lists up to 100 individual payments to creditor accounts.
