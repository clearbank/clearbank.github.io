## Multi-currency transactions

Multi-currency transaction endpoints allow you to retrieve:
- A list of transactions for a multi-currency account and any virtual accounts associated with it
- A list of transactions for a virtual multi-currency account
- A single transaction

You can also access [Multi-currency statements](#multi-currency-statements).

## Multi-currency statements

Your multi-currency bank statement is an official summary of financial transactions that have occurred for all multi-currency accounts within a calendar month.

Statements can be generated either for all accounts associated with your institution, or for a specified real account associated with your institution. The statement will be provided via a webhook (see [Use webhooks](../api/getting-started/#use-webhooks)).
