## High value international payments

You can send single or bulk high value payments overseas in currencies other than GBP. To be able to initiate high value international payments, we will need you to first [fund your SIM account](#fund-your-account-in-the-simulation-environment) while integrating with our API in the simulation environment. As part of our fund assessment control framework, you will not be able to initiate high value international payments without doing so.

ClearBank accepts inbound and outbound euro payments via the T2 scheme only. Inbound payments which are processed via any other scheme apart from T2 will not be accepted by ClearBank. Non-EUR high value international payments are settled according to cut-off times specific to the currency in which the payment is made.

For more information about the countries that you can send high value payments to, currencies supported by ClearBank and currency cut-off times, please speak to your Client Director.

### Payment cut-off times and scheduling
If a multi-currency payment request is received outside of the payment window for a given currency, you will normally receive a success response (202 - Accepted) including an **isScheduled** Boolean field. This will be set to **true**, indicating that the payment was received out-of-window and will be processed on the next available business day. If the field is set to **false**, the payment will be processed in the currently open payment window.

When a payment is scheduled for processing on the next available business day, the time at which the payment will be processed will vary depending on the currency selected as follows:

If you would prefer not to have the rescheduled payment processed, you can cancel the payment by using the cancellation endpoints. The cancellation must be received no later than 1 hour prior to the scheduled processing time. Note that to be able to cancel a payment, you must have specified a **batch ID** in the original payment request.

* Use [DELETE /v1/mccy/payments/{batchId}](#cancel-batch-payments) to cancel a whole batch of payments
* Use [DELETE /v1/mccy/payments/{batchId}/{endToEndId}](#cancel-a-single-payment) to cancel a single payment or an individual payment within a batch

## Internal transfer (MCCY)

You can initiate payments between two ClearBank multi-currency accounts that you operate. This process is known as an internal transfer request. For an internal transfer request to be processed successfully, it is imperative that both accounts are enabled for the instructed currency.

  title="Request an internal transfer"

    {
