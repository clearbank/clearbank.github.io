## Our API

The ClearBank API is a JSON RESTful API which allows you to interact with our Accounts, Clearing, and Embedded Banking products. [Webhooks](./getting-started#use-webhooks) are used to deliver asynchronous event notifications such as transaction confirmations and account-specific reconciliations as they occur.

The ClearBank API is available for consumption by financial institutions, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulated businesses, and fintech companies which have been onboarded with ClearBank.

## Building your system

To create a working system, you will need to log in and authenticate, be able to create and manage accounts, make transactions, and support reconciliation and reporting.

Once built, the validation steps are:

1. You test your connectivity and interaction with our full suite of endpoints and webhooks in a simulation environment (sandbox).
2. We take you through a QA process to confirm successful integration.
3. Finally, you will be promoted to use the API in a live/production environment.
