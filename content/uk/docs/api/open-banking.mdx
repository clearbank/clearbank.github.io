## Open banking API for Third Party Providers (TPPs)
We provide Third Party Providers (TPPs) with an open banking API powered by Ozone, allowing them to offer **Account Information Services (AIS)** and **Payment Initiation Services (PIS)** to eligible member accounts. The API is based on the [open banking standards](https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/).

If you're a TPP looking to leverage our open banking API services, you can find the full API specification on the [Ozone Open Banking Developer Portal](https://developer.sandbox.clrb.uk-hub-prod.ozoneapi.co.uk/en-gb).
