## Savings accounts

ClearBank supports singular and joint savings accounts. A savings account is an FSCS-protected account that can accrue interest on behalf of a customer. If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your Client Director.

You can choose how much interest to pay customers. ClearBank will calculate accruals and post regular interest payments. For information on how to set up interest configurations, refer to [Interest configuration](./interest-configuration).

<Callout colour="blue">
Both single and joint savings accounts can be created using the v2 endpoint.  For joint accounts, include multiple customer IDs in the <b>Customers</b> array.</Callout>

**To create a savings account:**
1. Check that you already have a customer defined. This can be a retail or business customer. If you need to create a retail customer, use the [Create a retail customer](./retail-customers#create-a-retail-customer) endpoint.
2. Use the [POST /v2/savings](#create-a-savings-account) endpoint to create the account on behalf of the customer.
> The `interestConfigurationId` field is used to provide the initial interest configuration ID when creating the savings account (refer to [Interest configuration](./interest-configuration)).
3. Set the nominated account using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-a-nominated-account) endpoint.
> **Note:** A <strong>nominated account</strong> is the account that accrued interest, if any, will be transferred into upon closure of the savings account. Name matching between accounts is your responsibility.

![Submit the POST /v2/savings endpoint. Once you receive a 201 response, submit the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account to set up a nominated account. Once you receive a 200 response, funds can now be added to the savings account.](/assets/images/savings-account-open.svg)

<Callout colour="blue">
Always note down the X-Request-Id when creating an account. If you receive a 500 response, resubmitting the request with the same X-Request-Id will avoid creating a duplicate account.
</Callout>

Once you have opened a savings account, you can deposit and withdraw payments using the Faster Payments or CHAPS payment endpoints. Incoming or outgoing Bacs payments are not accepted.

You can retrieve information on all savings accounts by using the [GET /v3/accounts](#get-all-real-accounts-including-savings-accounts) endpoint and filtering for savings accounts, or retrieve information for a specific savings account through the [GET /v3/Accounts/{accountId}](#get-information-for-a-savings-account) endpoint.

You can amend a savings account with the [PATCH /v1/accounts/{accountId}](#amend-a-savings-account) endpoint.

To retrieve end of day balances for a savings account, use the [camt.053 endpoints](../gbp-accounts/account-reporting#statements).

<Callout colour="blue">
These are the same endpoints used to retrieve and amend information on real accounts.
</Callout>

**To close a savings account:**
1. Withdraw all funds from the account.
2. Verify that a nominated account has been defined. You can obtain details of the currently configured nominated account using the [GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#get-a-nominated-account) endpoint.
3. Use the [POST /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#close-a-savings-account) endpoint.
> The process is asynchronous and can take longer if an interest calculation is pending. Unpaid accrued interest, if any, will be deposited into the nominated account. If there is no interest to be paid, then it's possible to close the account without a nominated account being defined.
4. OPTIONAL Check closure status using the [GET /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#get-account-closure-status) endpoint.
5. The [Account Closure Completed webhook](#account-closure-completed-webhook) will be sent once the account has closed.

![To close an account, set the nominated account using the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account endpoint. Once you receive a 200 response, submit the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account to set up a nominated account. Once you receive a 200 response, funds can now be added to the savings account.](/assets/images/savings-account-close.svg)

<Callout colour="blue">
Webhooks are not instant and may take up to the following day to arrive. Wait until you receive a webhook before trying to close the account again.
</Callout>

Account closure may fail due to the nominated account details being incorrect. You will know from the `ClosureFailureReason` field in the Account Closure Failed webhook.

See the following possible combinations of `accountStatus` and `closureStatus`:

| accountStatus | closureStatus | Description                 |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Enabled       | None          | No closure request submitted |
| Enabled       | Pending       | Closure requested, interest being calculated |
| Enabled       | Failed        | Closure request failed, see `closureFailureReasons` field for details |
| Suspended     | Pending       | Closure requested for suspended account, interest being calculated |
| Closed        | Complete      | Closure completed successfully |

<br/> <br/>
<Callout colour="blue">
If account closure fails and hasn't been resolved by the end of the month, then accrued interest, if any, will be paid into the account. You will need to empty the account again before retrying the closure.
</Callout>

**To reset the nominated account and close the account:**
1. OPTIONAL Obtain details of the currently configured nominated account using the [GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#get-a-nominated-account) endpoint.
2. Correct the nominated account details using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-a-nominated-account) endpoint.
4. Use the [POST /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#close-a-savings-account) endpoint.
> The process is asynchronous. Unpaid accrued interest, if any, will be deposited into the nominated account.
5. OPTIONAL Check closure status using the [GET /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#get-account-closure-status) endpoint.
6. The [Account Closure Completed webhook](#account-closure-completed-webhook) will be sent once the account has closed.

#### Example request bodies for creating a savings account with multiple customers

##### Example joint account with two customers

```json
{
  "ownerName": "John and Jane Smith",
  "sortCode": "010203",
  "productId": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d",
  "customers": [
    {
      "customerId": "0f1e2d3c-4b5a-6c7d-8e9f-0a1b2c3d4e5f",
      "customerId": "abcdef12-3456-7890-1234-56789abcdef0"
    }
  ],
  "interestConfigurationId": "1234abcd-5678-9ef0-1234-56789abcdef0"
}
```
While joint accounts will typically have two customers, we can support any amount with a valid use case.

##### Example joint account with four customers

```json
{
  "ownerName": "John Smith, Jane Smith, Steve Doe, and Emily Doe",
  "sortCode": "010203",
  "productId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a7b8-c9d0-e1f2a3b4c5d6",
