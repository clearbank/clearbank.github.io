## Retail customers

FSCS-protected deposits are a part of our embedded banking proposition. An FSCS-protected deposit is a physical account held with ClearBank and is only available to our embedded banking customers for the purpose of sending and/or receiving payments. The balance of an FSCS-protected deposit is held by ClearBank and can be viewed via the ClearBank Portal and the API. Additionally, FSCS-protected deposits are reconciled for you by ClearBank.

<Callout colour="blue">
To close an embedded banking account, call the <a href="#amend-or-update-an-embedded-banking-account">PATCH /v1/accounts/&#123;accountId&#125;</a> endpoint and set the <b>Status</b> field to <b>Closed</b>.

Embedded banking accounts created using the <a href="#create-an-embedded-banking-account">POST /v4/Accounts</a> endpoint cannot be reopened once they've been closed.
