## Retail customers

FSCS-protected deposits are a part of our embedded banking proposition. An FSCS-protected deposit is a physical account held with ClearBank and is only available to our embedded banking customers for the purpose of sending and/or receiving payments. The balance of an FSCS-protected deposit is held by ClearBank and can be viewed via the ClearBank Portal and the API. Additionally, FSCS-protected deposits are reconciled for you by ClearBank.

Cash ISAs first require a retail customer to be created. You can create and manage retail customers using the following endpoints.  
Once you've created a retail customer, you then create and manage their cash ISA using the endpoints on the [Flexible cash ISAs](/uk/docs/embedded-banking/flexible-cash-isas) page.
