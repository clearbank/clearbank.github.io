## Retail customers

These endpoints are used to create and update retail customers for all customer accounts used by our embedded banking partners.

### FSCS protected deposits

FSCS-protected deposits are a part of our embedded banking proposition. An FSCS-protected deposit is a physical account held with ClearBank and is only available to our embedded banking customers for the purpose of sending and/or receiving payments. The balance of an FSCS-protected deposit is held by ClearBank and can be viewed via the ClearBank Portal and the API. Additionally, FSCS-protected deposits are reconciled for you by ClearBank.

For retail customers, an individual can be:
- The person holding the account
- A primary party for the account
- An individual with power of attorney over the account

You can create an individual using the [/customers/v2/individuals](#create-a-retail-customer) endpoint.

Once you have created a customer, you can create FSCS-protected accounts using the following endpoints:
- [Customer accounts](./business-banking-customer-accounts)
- [Savings accounts](./savings-accounts)
- [Cash ISAs](./flexible-cash-isa)

To create an operating account, use the endpoints on the [Manage sterling accounts page](../gbp-accounts/manage-accounts) page.
