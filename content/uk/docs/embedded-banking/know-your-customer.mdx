## Know Your Customer (KYC)

With out Know Your Customer (KYC) service, you can conveniently conduct KYC checks for your customers via API. By simply sharing key customer information, we'll conduct the checks and then return you the result in a webhook.

If the check comes back successful, we'll automatically create a new customer for you using the original details provided.
