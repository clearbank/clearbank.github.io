## Know Your Customer (KYC)

Meet KYC obligations straightforwardly with our API endpoint. By simply sharing key customer information, we'll conduct KYC checks then return their result in a webhook.

For convenience, we'll also use the provided information to register a new customer if the checks pass.

If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your Client Director.
