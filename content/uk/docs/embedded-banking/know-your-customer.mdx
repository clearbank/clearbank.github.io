## Retail Customer KYC

<Callout colour="green">
<h2>Verification of Payee is coming soon</h2>
<p>All information on this page describes a solution that is <strong>not yet live in production and therefore could change</strong>. This includes any endpoint and webhook details. The information is being provided early to aid you in integrating with our API in our UK simulation environment.</p>
</Callout>

Using our retail KYC endpoint makes it easy to meet your due diligence requirements when onboarding retail customers. By simply sharing key customer information, you can conduct know your customer checks and receive the results via webhook.

For convenience, we'll also use the provided information to register a new customer if the checks succeed.

If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your Client Director.
