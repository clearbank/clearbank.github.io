## Current accounts

ClearBank supports current accounts. A current accounts is an FSCS-protected account that can be used by [business customers](./business-customers), [retail customers](./retail-customers), and [sole traders](./sole-traders) to send and receive payments.

Current accounts can be supported by a [savings account](./savings-accounts), which can accrue interest on behalf of a customer.

**To create a customer account:**
1. If not already present, create a retail customer using the [Create a retail customer](./manage-retail-customers) endpoint.
2. Use the [POST /v4/Accounts](#create-an-account) endpoint to create the account.
