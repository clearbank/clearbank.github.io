## Sole trader customers

A sole trader is a self-employed person who owns and operates their own business.

<Callout colour="blue">To open a business customer, refer to <a href="./business-customers">Business customers</a>.</Callout>

Because sole trader accounts are structured differently to other account types, you will need to use the endpoints defined on this page to interact with them. Do not use the endpoints listed on the [Manage sterling accounts page](../gbp-accounts/manage-accounts).

To create a sole trader account, use the [POST /v1/customers/soletrader](#create-a-sole-trader) endpoint.

You can update the sole trader using the [PATCH /v1/customers/soletrader/{customerId}](#update-an-existing-sole-traders-personal-information) endpoint, and update a business customer's address with the [PUT /v1/customers/soletrader/{customerId}/currentAddress](#update-an-existing-sole-traders-address) endpoint.

Once you have created a sole trader, you can create FSCS-protected accounts using the following endpoints:
- [Current accounts](./current-accounts)
- [Savings accounts](./savings-accounts)
