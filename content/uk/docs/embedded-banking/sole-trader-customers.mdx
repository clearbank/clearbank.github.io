## Sole trader customers

A sole trader is a type of business [defined by the UK government](https://www.gov.uk/become-sole-trader) that has only one employee.

<Callout colour="blue">To open a business customer, refer to <a href="./business-customers">Business customers</a>.</Callout>

Because sole trader accounts are structured differently to other account types, you will need to use the endpoints defined on this page to interact with them. Do not use the endpoints listed on the [Manage sterling acounts page](./manage-accounts).

To create a sole trader account, use the [POST /v1/customers/soletrader](#create-a-sole-trader) endpoint.

Once you have created a sole trader, you can:
- [Open a current account](./current-accounts)
- [Open an interest-bearing savings account](./savings-accounts)
