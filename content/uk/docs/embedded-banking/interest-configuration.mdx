## Interest configuration

You can update the interest configuration of your existing savings accounts. This functionality is enabled on a per-client basis, so please reach out if you'd like to use it.

The initial interest configuration ID is usually set during account creation. You can request a new configuration ID from your usual ClearBank contact. 

You can:
- **Update** your interest configuration using the [POST /interest/v1/accounts/{accountId}/configurations](#update-interest-configuration) endpoint
- **Get** all interest configurations set for an account using the [GET /interest/v1/accounts/{accountId}/configurations](#get-an-accounts-interest-configurations) endpoint
- **Set future-dated** interest configurations using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/future-configurations](#set-future-dated-interest-configurations) endpoint
- **Delete** all future interest configurations using the [DELETE /v1/accounts/{accountId}/future-configurations](#delete-future-dated-interest-configurations) endpoint

The interest rate will apply for the whole of the day on which it is set. Interest is calculated in the early hours of the following morning based on data from midnight UK time.

### Daily interest example

If you update an interest product at 15:00 on Tuesday, all of Tuesday's interest, even before 15:00, will be calculated at the new interest rate. The Interest Paid and Transaction Settled webhooks will notify you of the amount of interest paid each day.

This diagram shows the message flow:

### Monthly interest example

If you update an interest product at 14:00 on the 5th, interest from the 1st to the 4th will be calculated at the previous rate at the end of the month. Interest from the 5th until the end of the month will be calculated using the new rate. The Interest Paid and Transaction Settled webhooks will notify you of the amount of interest paid at the end of the month.

### Future-dating interest configurations

You can set multiple future interest configurations for your account with the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/future-configurations](#set-future-dated-interest-configurations) endpoint. Once set, this endpoint also replaces any existing future-dated configurations for the account.

Each selected interest configuration will apply from the start of the day provided in the `effectiveFrom` field. For example, you might set an account to move from interest config A to interest config B on 1 August. Interest will be calculated based on the balance from midnight on 31 July using interest config A. Any future interest interest calculations will be based on interest config B until any further changes to the interest configurations come into effect.

If you update the interest configuration using the [POST /interest/v1/accounts/{accountId}/configurations](#update-interest-configuration) endpoint while future-dated configurations are set, the update will remain active until the next future-dated configuration takes effect. For example, updating to config C on 1 October will apply until 14 October if a future-dated config D is set to start on 15 October. Config D will then take effect as scheduled.

Use the [DELETE /v1/accounts/{accountId}/future-configurations](#delete-future-dated-interest-configurations) endpoint to remove all future-dated interest configurations from an account. The account will remain on its current interest configuration.
