## Business banking customer accounts

This endpoint is used to create an [FSCS-protected](./manage-retail-customers#fscs-protected-deposits) current account. This endpoint is specific to our embedded banking partners. If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your Client Director.

**To create a customer account:**
1. If not already present, create a retail customer using the [Create a retail customer](./manage-retail-customers) endpoint.
2. Use the [POST /v4/Accounts](#create-an-account) endpoint to create the account.
