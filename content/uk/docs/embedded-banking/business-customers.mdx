## Business customers

A business customer is a business [registered with the UK government](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business/limited-company). A business customer can either be a partnership or a limited company.

<Callout colour="blue">To open a sole trader customer, refer to <a href="./sole-trader-customers">Sole trader customers</a>.</Callout>

Because registered company accounts are structured differently to other account types, you will need to use the endpoints defined on this page to interact with them. Do not use the endpoints listed on the [Manage sterling accounts page](./manage-accounts).

To create a business customer, use the [POST /v1/customers/business](#create-a-business-customer) endpoint.

You can update the business customer using the [PATCH /v1/customers/business/{customerId}](#update-an-existing-business-customer) endpoint, and update a business customer's address with the [PUT /v1/customers/business/{customerId}/currentAddress](#update-an-existing-business-customers-address) endpoint.

To manage directors and Ultimate Beneficiary Owners (UBOs) for business customers, you can use various endpoints:

| Action               | Endpoint                                                                                                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create a Director    | [POST /v1/customers/business/{customerId}/director](#create-a-new-director-for-a-business-customer) |
| Update a Director    | [PATCH /v1/customers/business/{customerId}/director/{directorId}](#update-a-director-for-a-business-customer) |
| Delete a Director    | [DELETE /v1/customers/business/{customerId}/director/{directorId}](#delete-a-director-for-a-business-customer) |
| Create a UBO         | [POST /v1/customers/business/{customerId}/ubo](#create-a-new-ultimate-beneficiary-owner-for-a-business-customer) |
| Update a UBO         | [PATCH /v1/customers/business/{customerId}/ubo/{uboId}](#update-an-ultimate-beneficiary-owner-for-a-business-customer) |
| Delete a UBO         | [DELETE /v1/customers/business/{customerId}/ubo/{uboId}](#delete-an-ultimate-beneficiary-owner-for-a-business-customer) |

Once you have created a business customer, you can create FSCS-protected accounts using the following endpoints:
- [Current accounts](./current-accounts)
- [Savings accounts](./savings-accounts)
