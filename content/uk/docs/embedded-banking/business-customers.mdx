## Business customers

A business customer is a business [registered with the UK government](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business/limited-company). A business customer can either be a partnership or a limited company.

<Callout colour="blue">To open a sole trader customer, refer to <a href="./sole-trader-customers">Sole trader customers</a>.</Callout>

Because registered company accounts are structured differently to other account types, you will need to use the endpoints defined on this page to interact with them. Do not use the endpoints listed on the [Manage sterling acounts page](./manage-accounts).

To create a registered company account, use the [POST /v1/customers/business](#create-a-business-customer) endpoint.

Once you have created a sole trader, you can:
- Open a [current account](./current-accounts)
- Open an [interest-bearing current account](./savings-accounts)
