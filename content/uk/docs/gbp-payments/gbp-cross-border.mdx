## GBP Cross-Border

Cross-border payments are financial transactions where the payer and the recipient are based in separate countries. Our GBP Cross-Border payment product enables you to send sterling payments to any sterling account, in any permissible overseas jurisdiction. 
Payments are guaranteed to settle on the same-day, as long as the instruction is received before 5pm UK time on that working day.

There is no limit to the amount that can be sent using this service.

You can send GBP cross-border payments using the [POST /payments/cross-border-sterling/v3/payments](#send-a-gpb-cross-border-payment) endpoint. 

Settlement details are provided to you via the [Transaction Settled](#transaction-settled-webhook) webhook. 

<Callout colour="blue">
  It is important to verify your firewall settings to ensure that they do not block <a href="#transaction-settled-webhook">Transaction Settled webhook</a> notifications, which can include a large payload due to the size of the Iso20022XmlDocument field.
</Callout>

**Things to note:**

- You can initiate a payment during the sterling availability period, 08:00 to 17:00 (UK time), on business days. Payments sent before or after this window will be rejected with a 400 Bad Request response.
- If you use **version 3** of the endpoint and choose to provide the optional Intermediary Agent field, the provided BIC must be a GB BIC belonging to a [CHAPS Direct Participant](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/chaps#anchor_1672828379351). Additionally, there must be a valid payment routing path from the Intermediary Agent to the Creditor Agent. If there is no valid routing path, or you provide a BIC that is not a GB BIC and a CHAPS Direct Participant, the payment will be rejected. If you're unsure, it's best to leave the Intermediary Agent field blank.
- You can recognise a Transaction Settled webhook that describes a GBP Cross-Border payment by checking the **TransactionSource** is set to **Cross Border GBP**.

<Callout colour="blue">
If you receive a Transaction Rejected webhook outside of <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/chaps">industry opening hours</a>, retry the payment during the next open window.
</Callout>

The GBP Cross-Border endpoint supports the new ISO 20022 payment message formats, specifically pacs.008.

### Version 3 mandatory fields
In line with the Bank of England's ISO 20022 data enhancement requirements, you will be required to provide additional details on the debtor and creditor such as the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), Purpose Code and Category Purpose Code.

You can find further details about these fields on our Knowledge Centre, or access a list of all the recommended Purpose and Category Purpose Codes and their definitions on the Bank of England website: <ExternalLink href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/payments/rtgs-renewal-programme/iso-20022/uk-recommended-purpose-code-list.pdf">UK recommended Purpose Code PDF</ExternalLink>.

#### Legal Entity Identifer (LEI)
The LEI is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO 17442 standard and contains information about an entity’s ownership structure. Providing the LEI is mandatory for pacs.008 where the party being described (debtor or creditor) is a financial institution. Otherwise, it is an optional field but strongly recommended to include when the party is an organisation.

#### Purpose Codes and Category Purpose Codes
The Purpose Code captures the nature of the payment and should be transported end to end. The Purpose Code is 4 characters used to abbreviate the purpose, for example, IVPT - Invoice Payment.

The Category Purpose Code is used to identify the broader nature of the payment and is used by agents. There are fewer Category Purpose Codes as this is providing a higher level understanding. In total there are 127 Purpose Codes and 28 Category Purpose Codes.

To help make sense of the various codes, they have been broken down into eight categories in the following table. The categories have been created by ClearBank to support our clients in finding the appropriate codes for their use case when making GBP Cross-Border payments.

<Callout colour="blue">
ClearBank are mandated to prioritise identifying which payments are linked to Property – therefore if you are looking to complete a property-related payment, ensure that you make use of these Purpose Codes in your payment instruction.
</Callout>

For your convenience, Purpose Codes and Category Purpose Codes with the same value are shown in bold.

### Populating the Creditor field in pacs.008 Payments

The `Creditor` field in GBP Cross-Border pacs.008 messages identifies the party receiving the funds. This party may be an **individual**, a **business**, or a **financial institution**. The correct population of this field is essential for accurate payment routing and compliance with ISO 20022 standards.

#### Creditor vs Creditor Agent

Under ISO 20022 terminology:

- **Creditor**: The recipient of the funds. This may be an individual, business, or financial institution.
- **Creditor Agent**: The financial institution that holds the account into which the funds are credited. This party **must always** be a financial institution and **must always** have a valid BIC.

<Callout colour="blue">
For the GBP Cross-Border v3 endpoint, the **CreditorAgent** BIC is mandatory. While the **Creditor** BIC field is still present in the pacs.008 schema, it is **optional** and should only be populated if the end creditor is a financial institution.
</Callout>

This distinction is part of Enhanced Data requirements, which aim to improve clarity around the roles of parties in a payment transaction.

#### Population guidance

|Creditor type	|Creditor field population	|CreditorAgent field population|
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Individual	|Full name of the individual	|BIC of the financial institution holding the account|
|Business	|Registered business name	|BIC of the financial institution holding the account|
|Financial Institution	|Institution name (if acting as Creditor)	|BIC of the financial institution holding the account|

- The **Creditor** does **not** require a BIC.
- The **Creditor Agent** must always be populated with a valid BIC to enable correct payment routing.

#### Example scenarios

1. 
. **Payment to a non-GB individual**  
   - Creditor: `Carlos Mendoza` (based in Spain)  
   - Creditor Agent: `ESXXEXAMPLEXXX` (example non-GB BIC)

2. **Payment to a non-GB business**  
   - Creditor: `TechNova GmbH` (based in Germany)  
   - Creditor Agent: `ESXXEXAMPLEXXX` (example non-GB BIC)

3. **Payment directly to a financial institution**  
   - Creditor: `Banco Ejemplo` (based in Spain)  
   - Creditor Agent: `ESXXEXAMPLEXXX` (example non-GB BIC)

<Callout colour="blue">
In the third example, the **creditor** and **creditor agent** are both financial institutions. In this case, the creditor BIC may be optionally populated to reflect the identity of the receiving institution.
