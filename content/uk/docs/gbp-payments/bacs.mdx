## Bacs Payment Services Providers

Bacs (Bankers' Automated Clearing Services) is a UK payment system used for direct debit and direct credit transactions.

There are two types of participants within Bacs:
- Payment Service Providers (PSPs)
- Service Users (often called Originator)

PSPs are authorised participants within the Bacs scheme. They can receive Bacs Direct Debit instructions and return them if necessary (for example, due to insufficient funds or account closure). PSPs cannot initiate or originate Direct Debits themselves.

Only Service Users are permitted to originate Direct Debits. While all Service Users are PSPs, not all PSPs act as Service Users. If you are a Service User, refer to [Bacs Service Users](#bacs-service-users).

<Callout colour="blue">
Note that the ClearBank system will perform the majority of these tasks for you - the only task we cannot perform is a balance check against a Virtual Account.
</Callout>

Bacs operates on a three-day cycle. On the **input day**, a file of payments is sent to Bacs. ClearBank receives details of payments to be made on the **processing day**. Payments are applied to accounts on the **entry day**. Bacs does not operate on weekends or bank holidays.

![Image showing 3-day Bacs payment cycle](/assets/images/BacsOverview-Days.svg "Bacs payment cycle")

As inbound Bacs payments can either be credit or debit payments, the successful payment scenario can result in money moving either to or from the end-customer's account.
When a payment is successfully applied to an account, this message flow occurs:

![Image showing a successful Bacs payment](/assets/images/BacsOverview-PaymentSuccess.svg "Successful Bacs payment")

If you subscribe to the [Bacs Direct Debit Inbound Payment Created](#bacs-direct-debit-inbound-payment-created-webhook) and [Bacs Direct Credit Inbound Payment Created](#bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-created-webhook) webhooks, then you can use the information to notify the account owner of a pending payment scheduled to occur on day 3. You can use the Bacs transaction ID to associate the webhooks that describe each payment. Note that credit payments can be recalled up to 4pm on the processing day by the originator; in this case you will be notified by a [Bacs Direct Credit Recalled webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-recalled-webhook) and the credit will not appear in the account.

Whether a payment is successfully applied to the end-customer's account is determined like this:

![Image showing a Inbound Bacs decision tree](/assets/images/BacsOverview-DecisionTree.svg "Inbound Bacs decision tree")

If the payment cannot be applied to the account, ClearBank will automatically raise an ARUCS (Automated Return of Unapplied Credits Service) item  or an ARUDD (Automated Return of Unpaid Direct Debit) item. You will be notified with a [Bacs Direct Credit Return Created](#bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook) or [Bacs Direct Debit Return Created](#bacs-direct-debit-return-created-webhook) webhook. Note that if a Direct Debit is paid from a virtual account, it is your responsibility to ensure that the account has sufficient funds. If it does not, use the returns endpoints below.

## Returning a Bacs payment

You can choose to return a payment that has been applied. Returns should be initiated straight away, but can be initiated until 15:30 (UTC) the working day after settlement.

**To return a Direct Credit** use the endpoints below and specify the reason for return using a [Direct Credit reason code](#arucs-direct-credit-reason-codes). ClearBank will notify you with a [Bacs Direct Credit Return Created webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook) on the day the return is created (Day 3 or 4).  The funds will be transferred to your Bacs suspense account on the same day and returned on Day 5 or 6. The message flow is shown here:

![Image showing a Inbound Bacs decision tree](/assets/images/BacsOverview-ReturnsDC.svg "Message flow: Return a Direct Credit")

**To return a Direct Debit** use the endpoints below and specify the reason for return using a [Direct Debit reason code](#arudd-direct-debit-reason-codes). ClearBank will notify you with a [Bacs Direct Debit Return Created webhook](#bacs-direct-debit-return-created-webhook) on the day the return is created (Day 3 or 4). The funds will be transferred from your Bacs suspense account to the end-customer's account on the same day and returned on Day 5 or 6. The rest of the message flow is similar to returning a Direct Credit and is shown here:

![Image showing a Inbound Bacs decision tree](/assets/images/BacsOverview-ReturnsDD.svg "Message flow: Return a Direct Debit")

Use the endpoint below to return payments from a real account. To return payments from a virtual account, use: [/v1/Accounts/{accountId}/Virtual/{virtualAccountId}/Transactions/Returns](#return-bacs-payment-virtual-account)

## Direct Debit Instructions

A Direct Debit Instruction (DDI) is an authorisation to collect future payments from a nominated account.
A DDI can be submitted to ClearBank by service users in two ways:
- Electronically via the Bacs Automated Direct Debit Instruction Service (AUDDIS), or,
- Sent as a paper instruction to your address to be entered via the ClearBank API after you have validated it.

A DDI can be set up against a real or virtual account held with ClearBank. It cannot be set up against a General Segregated Account, your Bacs Suspense Account, or your Minimum Mandated Balance account. You will receive the [Bacs Mandate Initiated webhook](#bacs-mandate-initiated-webhook) once the DDI is present in our system.

If you are transferring an existing sort code to ClearBank that already has DDIs set up, you will need to use the API to inform us of these.

Once a DDI has been set up against an account via AUDDIS, payments may be collected from the account from the third day; for paper instructions, payments may be collected from the following day.
The timing of the payment is in the control of the service user and does not necessarily follow immediately.

To receive feedback during DDI management, subscribe to the relevant webhooks which are listed here: [BACS DDI webhooks](#bacs-ddi-webhooks).

**Note**: Occasionally you might receive a [Bacs Mandate Cancellation Failed webhook](#bacs-mandate-cancellation-failed-webhook), after having cancelled a Direct Debit Instruction through the `DELETE` endpoints.  This does not necessarily mean a real failure. This situation can arise as in the following example:<br/>

An end-customer cancels their phone contract with "FabuPhone". FabuPhone immediately cancel the DDI through the Bacs system. The end-customer also requests that you cancel the DDI, and you attempt to do so using the `DELETE` endpoint. As the instruction was already cancelled, it no longer exists and cannot be found. You will then receive a Bacs Mandate Cancellation Failed webhook.<br/> 
You can use the `GET endpoint (GET /{vn}/Accounts/{accountId}/Mandates)` to check the DDIs in place for the account and verify that everything is as it should be.

### Dormant Direct Debit Instructions

Please note that ClearBank also performs weekly dormancy checks on Direct Debit Instructions set up against your accounts. After a set period of inactivity against a DDI, the instruction will be marked as **Cancelled** and further payment will not be processed.

By default, a DDI must be dormant for 24 months before it is automatically flagged for cancellation. However, this period can be extended by the service user in agreement with their sponsor bank. ClearBank uses the current value from the latest Direct Debit Originator (DDO) Database maintained by Pay.UK when we run the dormancy check.

If a Direct Debit is cancelled due to dormancy but is still required, the service user will need to arrange to send a new instruction.

## Bacs Direct Credit payment webhooks

ClearBank does not sponsor Direct Credits, so there are no outbound Direct Credit payments. The webhooks relating to inbound Direct Credit transactions are not associated with an endpoint, instead they are listed here:

- [Bacs Direct Credit Inbound Payment Created webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-created-webhook)    
- [Bacs Direct Credit Recalled webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-recalled-webhook)
- [Bacs Direct Credit Inbound Payment Held webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-held-webhook)
- [Transaction Settled webhook](#transaction-settled-webhook)
- [Bacs Direct Credit Return Created webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook) (this can occur automatically if ClearBank returns a payment, or in response to the Bacs returns endpoint)

<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-created-webhook-v2' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-credit-recalled-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-held-webhook-v3' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='transaction-settled-webhook-v6' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook-v4' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-unapplied-credit-received-webhook-v3' />

## Bacs Direct Debit payment webhooks

The webhooks that relate to inbound Direct Debit payments have no direct association with an endpoint:

- [Bacs Direct Debit Inbound Payment Created webhook](#bacs-direct-debit-inbound-payment-created-webhook)
- [Transaction Settled webhook](#transaction-settled-webhook)
- [Bacs Direct Debit Return Created webhook](#bacs-direct-debit-return-created-webhook) (this can occur automatically if ClearBank returns a payment, or in response to the Bacs returns endpoint)
- [Bacs Direct Debit Indemnity Claim Received Event webhook](#bacs-direct-debit-indemnity-claim-received-event-webhook)

These two webhooks relate to the origination of Direct Debit payments as they appear in the **service user's account**. You would see these if you were collecting the Direct Debit rather than paying it:
- [Bacs Debit Contra Received webhook](#bacs-debit-contra-received-webhook) - indicates funds received as a result of a Direct Debit file being processed. This is the bulk settlement.
- [Bacs Unpaid Direct Debit Received webhook](#bacs-unpaid-direct-debit-received-webhook) - indicates that a Direct Debit could not be paid.


<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-debit-inbound-payment-created-webhook-v2' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-debit-return-created-webhook-v4' />

## Bacs DDI webhooks

The following webhooks relate to managing Direct Debit Instructions. The webhooks can occur in response to an endpoint (as detailed below) but also if we receive a DDI from the Bacs payment service. The webhooks returned are the same regardless of whether a real or virtual account endpoint is used. Note that the webhook names include the term "mandate". This reflects the code, but should be understood to mean "Direct Debit Instruction".

| Event | Associated webhooks |
|---------|------------|
| [Create a DDI for a real account](#create-a-ddi-real-account) OR [Create a DDI for a virtual account](#create-a-ddi-virtual-account) | <ul><li>[Bacs Mandate Initiated webhook](#bacs-mandate-initiated-webhook)</li> <li>[Bacs Mandate Initiation Failed webhook](#bacs-mandate-initiation-failed-webhook)</li></ul> |
| [Cancel a DDI for a real account](#cancel-a-ddi-real-account) OR [Cancel a DDI for a virtual account](#cancel-a-ddi-virtual-account) | <ul><li>[Bacs Mandate Cancelled webhook](#bacs-mandate-cancelled-webhook)</li> <li>[Bacs Mandate Cancellation Failed webhook](#bacs-mandate-cancellation-failed-webhook)</li></ul> |
| [Return a DDI for a real account](#return-a-ddi-real-account) OR [Return a DDI for a virtual account](#return-a-ddi-virtual-account) | <ul><li>[Bacs Mandate Returned webhook](#bacs-mandate-returned-webhook)</li> <li>[Bacs Mandate Return Failed webhook](#bacs-mandate-return-failed-webhook)</li></ul> |

You may also receive a [Bacs Mandate Migrated webhook](#bacs-mandate-migrated-webhook) which is prompted by information received from Bacs.

<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-mandate-initiated-webhook-v2' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-mandate-initiation-failed-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-mandate-cancelled-webhook-v2' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-mandate-cancellation-failed-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-mandate-returned-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-mandate-return-failed-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-mandate-migrated-webhook-v2' />
