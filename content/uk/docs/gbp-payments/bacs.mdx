## Bacs

Bacs (Bankers' Automated Clearing Services) is a UK payment system used for direct debit and direct credit transactions.

There are two types of participants within Bacs:
- Payment Service Providers (PSPs)
- Service Users (often called Originator)

PSPs are authorised participants within the Bacs scheme. They can receive Bacs Direct Debit instructions and return them if necessary (for example, due to insufficient funds or account closure). PSPs cannot initiate or originate Direct Debits themselves.

Only Service Users are permitted to originate Direct Debits. While all Service Users are PSPs, not all PSPs act as Service Users. If you are a Service User, refer to [Bacs Service Users](#bacs-service-users).

<Callout colour="blue">
Note that the ClearBank system will perform the majority of these tasks for you - the only task we cannot perform is a balance check against a Virtual Account.
</Callout>

Bacs operates on a three-day cycle. On the **input day**, a file of payments is sent to Bacs. ClearBank receives details of payments to be made on the **processing day**. Payments are applied to accounts on the **entry day**. Bacs does not operate on weekends or bank holidays.

As inbound Bacs payments can either be credit or debit payments, the successful payment scenario can result in money moving either to or from the end-customer's account.
When a payment is successfully applied to an account, this message flow occurs:

![Image showing a successful Bacs payment](/assets/images/BacsOverview-PaymentSuccess.svg "Successful Bacs payment")

If you subscribe to the [Bacs Direct Debit Inbound Payment Created](#bacs-direct-debit-inbound-payment-created-webhook) and [Bacs Direct Credit Inbound Payment Created](#bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-created-webhook) webhooks, then you can use the information to notify the account owner of a pending payment scheduled to occur on day 3. You can use the Bacs transaction ID to associate the webhooks that describe each payment. Note that credit payments can be recalled up to 4pm on the processing day by the originator; in this case you will be notified by a [Bacs Direct Credit Recalled webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-recalled-webhook) and the credit will not appear in the account.

Whether a payment is successfully applied to the end-customer's account is determined like this:

![Image showing a Inbound Bacs decision tree](/assets/images/BacsOverview-DecisionTree.svg "Inbound Bacs decision tree")

If the payment cannot be applied to the account, ClearBank will automatically raise an ARUCS (Automated Return of Unapplied Credits Service) item  or an ARUDD (Automated Return of Unpaid Direct Debit) item. You will be notified with a [Bacs Direct Credit Return Created](#bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook) or [Bacs Direct Debit Return Created](#bacs-direct-debit-return-created-webhook) webhook. Note that if a Direct Debit is paid from a virtual account, it is your responsibility to ensure that the account has sufficient funds. If it does not, use the returns endpoints below.

## Returning a Bacs payment

You can choose to return a payment that has been applied. Returns should be initiated straight away, but can be initiated until 15:30 (UTC) the working day after settlement.

**To return a Direct Credit** use the endpoints below and specify the reason for return using a [Direct Credit reason code](#arucs-direct-credit-reason-codes). ClearBank will notify you with a [Bacs Direct Credit Return Created webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook) on the day the return is created (Day 3 or 4).  The funds will be transferred to your Bacs suspense account on the same day and returned on Day 5 or 6. The message flow is shown here:

![Image showing a Inbound Bacs decision tree](/assets/images/BacsOverview-ReturnsDC.svg "Message flow: Return a Direct Credit")

**To return a Direct Debit** use the endpoints below and specify the reason for return using a [Direct Debit reason code](#arudd-direct-debit-reason-codes). ClearBank will notify you with a [Bacs Direct Debit Return Created webhook](#bacs-direct-debit-return-created-webhook) on the day the return is created (Day 3 or 4). The funds will be transferred from your Bacs suspense account to the end-customer's account on the same day and returned on Day 5 or 6. The rest of the message flow is similar to returning a Direct Credit and is shown here:

![Image showing a Inbound Bacs decision tree](/assets/images/BacsOverview-ReturnsDD.svg "Message flow: Return a Direct Debit")

Use the endpoint below to return payments from a real account. To return payments from a virtual account, use: [/v1/Accounts/{accountId}/Virtual/{virtualAccountId}/Transactions/Returns](#return-bacs-payment-virtual-account)

<EndpointBlock
  type="post"
  title="Return Bacs payment (real account)"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/v1/Accounts/{accountId}/Transactions/Returns",
      version: "1.0",
      webhooks: [
      'bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook-v4',
      'bacs-direct-debit-return-created-webhook-v4',
      'transaction-settled-webhook-v6'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>
<EndpointBlock
  type="post"
  title="Return Bacs payment (virtual account)"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path:"/v1/Accounts/{accountId}/Virtual/{virtualAccountId}/Transactions/Returns",
      version: "1.0",
      webhooks: [
      'bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook-v4',
      'bacs-direct-debit-return-created-webhook-v4',
      'transaction-settled-webhook-v6'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

## Bacs Direct Credit payment webhooks

ClearBank does not sponsor Direct Credits, so there are no outbound Direct Credit payments. The webhooks relating to inbound Direct Credit transactions are not associated with an endpoint, instead they are listed here:

- [Bacs Direct Credit Inbound Payment Created webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-created-webhook)    
- [Bacs Direct Credit Recalled webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-recalled-webhook)
- [Bacs Direct Credit Inbound Payment Held webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-held-webhook)
- [Transaction Settled webhook](#transaction-settled-webhook)
- [Bacs Direct Credit Return Created webhook](#bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook) (this can occur automatically if ClearBank returns a payment, or in response to the Bacs returns endpoint)

<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-created-webhook-v2' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-credit-recalled-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-credit-inbound-payment-held-webhook-v3' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='transaction-settled-webhook-v6' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-credit-return-created-webhook-v4' />

- [Bacs Direct Debit Return Created webhook](#bacs-direct-debit-return-created-webhook) (this can occur automatically if ClearBank returns a payment, or in response to the Bacs returns endpoint)
