## Internal transfers

When sending payments via domestic [Faster Payments](./faster-payments) or [CHAPS](./chaps), there are two scenarios where the payment won't be sent to scheme and will instead be changed to an internal transfer:

- The payment is being sent to another account owned by you
- The recipient account is held by another ClearBank client

You can confirm whether the payment was sent via the intended scheme or internal transfer using the Transaction Settled webhook as detailed below.

### Confirm the payment method

To confirm the payment method used, refer to the **Scheme** field of the Transaction Settled webhook. If the payment method was changed to internal transfer, the Scheme field will be **Transfer**.
