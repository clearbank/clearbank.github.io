## Overview

Confirmation of Payee (CoP) gives you greater assurance that you are sending payments to the intended beneficiary. It not only helps in preventing accidental, misdirected payments but also reduces the risk associated with Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud. CoP is a scheme agnostic, peer-to-peer messaging service between accredited participants and sits completely outside of the payment journey. A CoP check can be made prior to setting up a payee or making a payment.

ClearBank is a CoP participant and will provide this account name checking service to customers who have onboarded onto our CoP service and use ClearBank sort codes linked to our bank code.

### Confirmation of Payee Aggregator Service

For customers who do not have sort codes linked to our bank code, or who use both their own bank code and ClearBank's bank code, the Confirmation of Payee Aggregator Service allows you to leverage your existing ClearBank integration to indirectly participate in the Confirmation of Payee service. This service allows:
- All of your accounts held at ClearBank to be CoP addressable
- For you to accept CoP name check requests on any account

CoP addressability allows other institutions to send inbound CoP name checks to ClearBank. ClearBank will return a response. You can also send an outbound name check request through ClearBank to return information on an account held at another institution.

## CoP respond (inbound)

If you have chosen to use the ClearBank CoP service, you must PATCH all of your accounts using the below endpoints. New accounts must also be patched to access CoP because account creation and account patching are two separate actions.

<Callout colour="blue">
To opt out specific accounts, first PATCH those accounts, then opt them out using the PUT endpoints below.
</Callout>

For your real and virtual accounts to be CoP-enabled, you will need to use the following PATCH endpoints to update your accounts:
-	[PATCH /v1/Accounts/{accountId}](../gbp-accounts/manage-accounts#amend-an-account-real)
-	[PATCH /v1/Accounts/{accountId}/Virtual/{virtualAccountId}](../gbp-accounts/manage-accounts#amend-an-account-virtual)

You need to provide:
- The name of the legal owner of the account
-	Nature of funds held in the account: `Personal` or `Business`
-	Operating nature of the account: `Single` or `Joint`

This enables us to respond to a CoP request from an external participant by completing a fuzzy matching check on the account in question.

For a real or virtual account to be opted out from using this service, you can use the following PUT endpoints:
-	[PUT /v1/Cop/opt/accounts/{accountId}](#opt-out-from-the-cop-service-real-account)
-	[PUT /v1/Cop/opt/accounts/{accountId}/virtual/{VirtualAccountId}](#opt-out-from-the-cop-service-virtual-account)

Further information about opting out from using our CoP service along with your responsibilities can be found in our Confirmation of Payee (CoP) Operating Guide. This document can be found in the Reference Documents section in the Knowledge Centre.

## CoP request (outbound)

Sending a CoP request to an external participant requires us to pass the request to the participant so that they can complete a fuzzy matching check on the account in question. 
To be able to send a CoP request (outbound) to an external participant, you will need to use the following POST endpoint so that the exact name registered with the payeeâ€™s account can be confirmed:
- [POST /open-banking/outbound/v1/name-verification](#check-name-registered-with-the-payees-account)

Once confirmed, we pass the result of the matching check back to you which you can then expose to your customer. Pay.UK have provided a messaging standard for you to follow. Further information about the messaging standard along with your responsibilities can be found in our Confirmation of Payee (CoP) Operating Guide. This document can be found in the Reference Documents section in the Knowledge Centre.

### CoP requests that require secondary reference data (SRD)

CoP checks are typically carried out on accounts that are addressable by sort code and account number, but can also be done for accounts that are addressable through secondary reference data (SRD). SRD-level checks are performed against the underlying account that is identified by the SRD rather than the name held against the sort code and account number. If an account requires SRD and it is not provided, the CoP check cannot be carried out.

<Callout colour="blue">
No accounts at ClearBank require SRD to be CoP addressable, however SRD can be added to your CoP checks if the payee's account requires it.
</Callout>

To check whether SRD will be required, use:
- [POST /open-banking/outbound/v1/srd/validate](#check-whether-a-sort-code-account-number-requires-srd-with-cop-requests)

If the CoP Check requires SRD, then it must be entered in the SecondaryIdentification field in the CoP request to enable the CoP responder to identify the account.

Supporting SRD-validated CoP checks is mandatory, however the integration that is required to support the SRD Validate endpoint, which is called ahead of the CoP check being sent is optional. Although not mandatory, this will inform your customers as to whether they need the secondary data ahead of sending the CoP check, making for a more streamlined and informed journey.

### Owner name formatting requirements

The **OwnerName** field is used to identify the owner of the account. The name must be provided in a structured or unstructured comma-delimited format. Both formats consist of three parts separated by commas. For simplicity, we recommend using the **unstructured** format for all CoP name verification requests.

- The unstructured format is valid for personal, business, and joint accounts. The full owner name string is populated in the third part.
- The structured format is only valid for personal accounts. The salutation, forename(s), and surname are separated by commas.

<Callout colour="blue">
Commas must be included, if omitted, it may cause delays in receiving the outcome of the verification from the external participant.
</Callout>

For reference, the following table gives examples of how the owner name should be formatted for different types of accounts:

| Format | Account type | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Unstructured | Personal | ``,,Mr John Smith``<br /> ``,,Mr John Andrew Smith``<br /> ``,,Mr John A Smith``  |
| Unstructured | Business | ``,,ClearBank Ltd``|
| Unstructured | Joint | ``,,John Smith and Jane MacDonald``<br /> ``,,Mr and Mrs J Smith``|
| Structured | Personal | ``Mr, John, Smith``<br /> ``Mr, John Andrew, Smith``<br /> ``Mr, John A, Smith``|
