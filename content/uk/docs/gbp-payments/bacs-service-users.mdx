## Bacs Service Users
 
As a Bacs **Service User** (also known as Originator) of Direct Debits, your responsibility is to construct and submit the payment instruction and Direct Debit Instruction.

This includes identifying the source and destination accounts, specifying the collection amount, and assigning a transaction reference. You also manage the customer authorisation process (known as a Direct Debit Instruction).

## Bacs inbound DDI payments
The following webhooks relate to the origination of Direct Debit payments as they appear in your account as the Service User:
- [Bacs Debit Contra Received webhook](#bacs-debit-contra-received-webhook) - Indicates funds received as a result of a Direct Debit file being processed. This is the bulk settlement.
- [Bacs Unpaid Direct Debit Received webhook](#bacs-unpaid-direct-debit-received-webhook) - Indicates that a Direct Debit could not be paid.
- [Bacs Direct Debit Indemnity Claim Received Event webhook](#bacs-direct-debit-indemnity-claim-received-event-webhook)
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-debit-contra-received-webhook-v3' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-unpaid-direct-debit-received-webhook-v3' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-direct-debit-indemnity-claim-received-event-webhook-v3' />
