## Bacs Service Users

As a Service User, you hold responsibility for initiating Direct Debit Originations (DDOs). This process enables you to collect payments from customers' bank accounts under the Direct Debit scheme.

ClearBank doesn’t provide APIs for submitting Direct Debit Originations directly to Bacs. Instead, you’ll need to use an accredited third-party service, such as Bacs approved software or a Bacs-approved bureau, to transmit these originations securely and in compliance with scheme rules.

You can use the following webhooks to receive information.
- [Bacs Debit Contra Received webhook](#bacs-debit-contra-received-webhook) - indicates funds received as a result of a Direct Debit file being processed. This is the bulk settlement.
- [Bacs Unpaid Direct Debit Received webhook](#bacs-unpaid-direct-debit-received-webhook) - indicates that a Direct Debit could not be paid.
- [Bacs Direct Debit Indemnity Claim Received Event webhook](#bacs-direct-debit-indemnity-claim-received-event-webhook)

<Callout color="blue">These webhooks can be responded to through Bacs software or a Bacs bureau.</Callout>

## Bacs DDI webhooks

The following webhooks relate to managing Direct Debit Instructions. The webhooks can occur in response to an endpoint (as detailed below) but also if we receive a DDI from the Bacs payment service. The webhooks returned are the same regardless of whether a real or virtual account endpoint is used. Note that the webhook names include the term "mandate". This reflects the code, but should be understood to mean "Direct Debit Instruction".

| Event | Associated webhooks |
|---------|------------|
| [Create a DDI for a real account](#create-a-ddi-real-account) OR [Create a DDI for a virtual account](#create-a-ddi-virtual-account) | <ul><li>[Bacs Mandate Initiated webhook](#bacs-mandate-initiated-webhook)</li> <li>[Bacs Mandate Initiation Failed webhook](#bacs-mandate-initiation-failed-webhook)</li></ul> |
| [Cancel a DDI for a real account](#cancel-a-ddi-real-account) OR [Cancel a DDI for a virtual account](#cancel-a-ddi-virtual-account) | <ul><li>[Bacs Mandate Cancelled webhook](#bacs-mandate-cancelled-webhook)</li> <li>[Bacs Mandate Cancellation Failed webhook](#bacs-mandate-cancellation-failed-webhook)</li></ul> |
| [Return a DDI for a real account](#return-a-ddi-real-account) OR [Return a DDI for a virtual account](#return-a-ddi-virtual-account) | <ul><li>[Bacs Mandate Returned webhook](#bacs-mandate-returned-webhook)</li> <li>[Bacs Mandate Return Failed webhook](#bacs-mandate-return-failed-webhook)</li></ul> |

You may also receive a [Bacs Mandate Migrated webhook](#bacs-mandate-migrated-webhook) which is prompted by information received from Bacs.
