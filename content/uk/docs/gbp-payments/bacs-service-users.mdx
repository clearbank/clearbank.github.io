## Bacs Service Users

As a Service User, you hold responsibility for initiating Direct Debit Originations (DDOs). This process enables you to collect payments from customers' bank accounts under the Direct Debit scheme.

ClearBank doesn’t provide APIs for submitting Direct Debit Originations directly to Bacs. Instead, you’ll need to use an accredited third-party service, such as Bacs approved software or a Bacs-approved bureau, to transmit these originations securely and in compliance with scheme rules.

You can use the following webhooks to receive information.
- [Bacs Debit Contra Received webhook](#bacs-debit-contra-received-webhook) - indicates funds received as a result of a Direct Debit file being processed. This is the bulk settlement.
- [Bacs Unpaid Direct Debit Received webhook](#bacs-unpaid-direct-debit-received-webhook) - indicates that a Direct Debit could not be paid.

<callout color="blue">These webhooks can be responded to through Bacs software or a Bacs bureau.</callout>
