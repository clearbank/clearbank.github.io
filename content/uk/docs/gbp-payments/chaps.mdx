## CHAPS

<Callout colour="blue"><h2>Deprecation notice</h2><p>The following endpoints were deprecated on <strong>1 November 2024</strong>:<br />
- <strong>POST payments/chaps/v4/customer-payments</strong><br />
- <strong>POST payments/chaps/v4/institution-payments</strong><br />
- <strong>POST payments/chaps/v4/return-payments</strong><br /></p>

 <p>These endpoints will remain available for use until <strong>1 May 2025</strong>. We recommend switching to version 5 of these endpoints. Please reach out to your Client Director with any questions.</p> <p>You can refer to our <a href="../api/versioning">versioning policy</a> and <a href="../api/support-life-cycle">support lifecycle information</a>.</p></Callout>

ClearBank accounts support inbound and outbound CHAPS payments. As CHAPS is the UK’s high value payment scheme, there is no amount limit associated with inbound or outbound CHAPS payments.
However, you can only send or return CHAPS payments between 08:00 – 17:00 Monday to Friday (excluding UK public holidays).

- CHAPS payments can be sent using the [POST payments/chaps/v4/customer-payments](#send-a-chaps-payment) endpoint.
- Settlement details are provided to you via the [Transaction Settled](#transaction-settled-webhook) webhook. 
- If you need to return a CHAPS payment, you can do so using the [POST /payments/chaps/v4/return-payments](#return-a-chaps-payment) endpoint.

<Callout colour="blue">
  It is important to verify your firewall settings to ensure that they do not block <a href="#transaction-settled-webhook">Transaction Settled webhook</a> notifications, which can include a large payload due to the size of the Iso20022XmlDocument field.
</Callout>

The latest versions of the CHAPS endpoints support the new ISO20022 payment message formats. See [FIN to ISO20022 field mapping](#fin-to-iso-20022-field-mapping) for guidance on how the previous MT numbered field values map to the new ISO20022 XML tags.

### Version 5 mandatory fields
In line with the Bank of England's ISO 20022 data enhancement requirements, you will be required to provide additional details on the debtor and creditor such as the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), Purpose Code and Category Purpose Code.

You can find further details about these fields on our Knowledge Centre, or access a list of all the recommended Purpose and Category Purpose Codes and their definitions on the Bank of England website: [UK recommended Purpose Code PDF](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/payments/rtgs-renewal-programme/iso-20022/uk-recommended-purpose-code-list.pdf)  

#### Legal Entity Identifer (LEI)
The LEI is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO 17442 standard and contains information about an entity’s ownership structure. Providing the LEI is mandatory for pacs.008 where the party being described (debtor or creditor) is a financial institution. Otherwise, it is an optional field but strongly recommended to include when the party is an organisation.

#### Purpose Codes and Category Purpose Codes
The Purpose Code captures the nature of the payment and should be transported end to end. The Purpose Code is 4 characters used to abbreviate the purpose, for example, IVPT - Invoice Payment.

The Category Purpose Code is used to identify the broader nature of the payment and is used by agents. There are fewer Category Purpose Codes as this is providing a higher level understanding. In total there are 127 Purpose Codes and 28 Category Purpose Codes.

To help make sense of the various codes, they have been broken down into eight categories in the following table. The categories have been created by ClearBank to support our clients in finding the appropriate codes for their use case when making GBP Cross-Border payments.

<Callout colour="blue">
ClearBank are mandated to prioritise identifying which payments are linked to Property – therefore if you are looking to complete a property-related payment, ensure that you make use of these Purpose Codes in your payment instruction.
</Callout>

For your convenience, Purpose Codes and Category Purpose Codes with the same value are shown in bold.

## CHAPS simulation endpoints

These endpoints can be used to simulate payments. You can also use them for automated testing.

- Simulate an inbound CHAPS payment (pacs.008) through the [POST /inbound-payment-simulation/chaps/v1/customer-payments](#simulate-an-inbound-chaps-payment) endpoint.
- Simulate a returned CHAPS payment (pacs.004) through the [POST /inbound-payment-simulation/chaps/v1/return-payments](#simulate-a-return-chaps-payment) endpoint.
- Simulate a CHAPS bank-to-bank payment (pacs.009) through the [POST /inbound-payment-simulation/chaps/v1/institution-payments](#simulate-a-chaps-bank-to-bank-payment) endpoint.

The ClearBank Payment Simulator should no longer be used for CHAPS payments.

## FIN to ISO20022 field mapping

As part of the Bank of England's RTGS Renewal Programme, the previous message format known as MT messages has changed to MX messages that are compliant with ISO20022.

This table provides information on the most relevant fields within the messages and their associated conversions.

|Field|Field name|MT103|MT202|Explanation|pacs.008 <br/>_(MT103 successor)_|pacs.009 <br/>_(MT202 successor)_|pacs.004 <br/>_(MT202 RTN successor)_|
