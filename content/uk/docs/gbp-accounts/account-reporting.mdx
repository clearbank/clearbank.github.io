## Camt.053 statements

You can request a statement containing all payment activity across your ClearBank accounts (sterling and multi-currency) for a completed business day, also referred to as a 'Bank to Customer Statement'. The statement is delivered in an ISO 20022 compliant XML file known as camt.053 (Cash Management message).

The statement is populated with transaction activity across all of your accounts within a given time range. Note that a transaction must be in a **Settled** state to be included. The **startDateTime** and **endDateTime** in your statement request must:
- be less than or equal to 25 hours apart
- be within the last 24 months (for example, on 1 July 2025, you can request transaction data back to and including 1 July 2023)
- be in the past

<Callout colour="blue">
We complete internal reconciliation for the previous business day in the early hours of the morning and will generate a statement for that period once reconciliation is complete (intraday statements are not available).
</Callout>

### UK time zone examples
The following examples highlight the differences in startDateTimeUtc and endDateTimeUtc depending on the current UK time zone including specific examples of the first day of a new time zone. See the diagram for a visual representation of these changes.

In these examples, the following parameters remain constant:
- ClearBank completes its reconciliation based on the current UK timezone
- The endpoint request must be in UTC time

|Scenario|startDateTimeUtc|endDateTimeUtc|Notes|
|--------|----------------|--------------|-----|
|**Requesting a statement in winter**<br /> It's 5 February 2024 <br /> I want to request yesterday's statement (4 February 2024) <br /> Yesterday and today's time zone: GMT (UTC+0) |2024-02-04T00:00:00Z|2024-02-05T00:00:00Z|GMT is equivalent to UTC so no adjustments are required to the times in the request.|
|**Requesting a statement in summer**<br /> It's 5 July 2024 <br /> I want to request yesterday's statement (4 July 2024) <br /> Yesterday and today's time zone: BST (UTC+**1 hour**) |2024-07-03T23:00:00Z|2024-07-04T23:00:00Z|BST is 1 hour ahead of UTC, therefore the times in the request must each be reduced by 1 hour.|
|**Requesting a statement after the time zone changes from GMT to BST**<br /> It's 1 April 2024 <br /> I want to request yesterday's statement (31 March 2024) <br /> Yesterday's time zone: GMT (UTC+0) and today's time zone: BST (UTC+**1 hour**) |2024-03-31T00:00:00Z|2024-03-31T23:00:00Z|When the time zone changes from GMT to BST on 31 March, the clocks go forward 1 hour making it a **23-hour day**.<br /> This means the start and end date of the request will both be 31 March.|
|**Requesting a statement after the time zone changes from BST to GMT**<br /> It's 2 November 2024 <br /> I want to request yesterday's statement (1 November 2024) <br /> Yesterday's time zone: BST (UTC+**1 hour**) and today's time zone: GMT (UTC+0) |2024-10-31T23:00:00Z|2024-11-02T00:00:00Z|When the time zone changes from BST to GMT on 1 November, the clocks go back 1 hour making it a **25-hour day**.<br /> This means the start and end date range of the request is from 31 October to 2 November.|

### How to request and download your statement
Use the **POST /v1/statementrequests** endpoint to request the generation of a camt.053 statement for a specific time range.

The process is shown in this message flow diagram:

<br />
<br />

![Image showing camt.053 statement message flow](/assets/images/camt053-message-flow.svg "camt.053 statement request message flow")

<br />

Once the statement has been generated, you will receive a **Statement Ready For Download** webhook containing a unique **MessageId** and a **TotalPages** value. The statement is divided into pages and each page is assigned a **PageNumber** value. If a page reaches the maximum number of transactions (5000), the statement is continued on a new page. Each page is a complete XML file starting with a group header. 

<Callout colour="blue">
Note that you will observe an expected delay in receiving the Statement Ready For Download webhook. The time taken to generate a statement varies depending on the number of settled transactions included in the request. <br />
<br />
If the endDateTimeUtc exceeds midnight UK time, then two calendar days will be included in the request. The statement will not be available until reconciliation has been completed for both days. This means that if you are requesting a statement for yesterday, but you include an hour of today, you won't get the statement until tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Once generated, statements are retained for 2 weeks.
</Callout>

To download a statement page, use the **GET /v1/statements/{messageId}** and provide the unique **MessageID** contained in the webhook and the **PageNumber** you wish to download. You can only download one statement page per request. If the generated statement contains multiple pages and you wish to download them all, repeat the GET call with an incremented page number until:
- **PageNumber** is equal to the **TotalPages** value in the webhook, or, 
- **LastPageIndicator** in the Group Header of the XML is **true**

We'll respond to the GET statement call with a **200 OK** response containing an **XMLObject**. This object contains the requested page of the camt.053 statement in XML format. The start of the statement page can be identified by the XML group header which will be in this format:

``` xml
