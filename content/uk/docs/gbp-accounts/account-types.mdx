## Overview

When you join ClearBank, you are given four financial accounts by default:

* An [Operating Account](#operating-account)
* A [General Segregation Account](#general-segregation-safeguarding-accounts)
* A [Bacs Suspense Account](#bacs-suspense-account)
* A [Mandated Minimum Balance Account](#mandated-minimum-balance-account)

<Callout colour="blue">
Your <strong>institution account</strong> is not a financial account: it is a digital representation of your institution with ClearBank. Through it you can access all your financial accounts. In this way, all your financial accounts are 'within' your institution account.
</Callout>

You can create additional Operating and General Segregation accounts.

### Create a GBP account

Real (non-virtual) GBP accounts can be created using the [POST /v3/Accounts endpoint](/uk/docs/gbp-accounts/manage-accounts#create-an-account-real).

You can specify the type of account using the **UsageType** field.  
The account type you choose should depend upon your agreement with ClearBank and the purpose of the account.

<Callout colour="blue">
An account's usage type is immutable. Take care to set the correct usage type when making a new account.
</Callout>

| Client Money Designated | ClientMoneyDesignated | Designated Client Account (Retail/Wholesale) |
| Safeguarded Pooled      | SafeguardedPooled     | Gen Seg Acc Retl/Wsale                       |
| Safeguarded Designated  | SafeguardedDesignated | Des Seg Acc Retl/Wsale                       |
| Client Suspense         | ClientSuspense        | -                                            |

You can specify an account's name using the **AccountName** field. See the endpoint's documentation for accepted characters.  
Account names are automatically prefixed with an abbreviated account-type label.

For example:  
An account created with the following parameters:  
**AccountName**: 'johns savings'  
**UsageType**: 'Segregated Designated'

When inspected using [**GET /v3/Accounts/{accountId}**](/uk/docs/gbp-accounts/manage-accounts#get-information-for-an-account-real) will return the name field `"Des Seg Wsale johns savings"`


~~When you create a real account:~~

~~For sterling accounts - use the **UsageType** field to select YourFunds, SegregatedDesignated, or SegregatedPooled, as shown above. If you need to create a client account, first create a safeguarding account using the [POST /v3/Accounts](./manage-accounts#create-an-account-real), then contact client services through Freshdesk to get a safeguarding letter???.~~

~~For multi-currency accounts - use the **Kind** field to select YourFunds, DesignatedSegregated,  GeneralSegregated, DesignatedClient, or GeneralClient.~~

~~The UsageType or Kind value determines the autogenerated prefix assigned to the account, for example, 'Gen Seg Acc Retl'. The prefixes for each account are shown in the table below.~~

### Safeguarding

Financial accounts can be safeguarded. A safeguarded account is subject to several protective measures which help keep customer money safe.

These measures include:
* **Segregation:** segregation ensures that your customer's money is held separately from your operating funds.
* **Insurance:** FSCS insurance protects customer money if your business becomes insolvent. Â£85,000 per customer across all accounts held at ClearBank are typically insured.

ClearBank provides you safeguarding letters as proof of your regulatory compliance to the FCA.

<Callout colour="blue">
An account is only safeguarded if you have received an FCA-compliant safeguarding letter from ClearBank. To receive this letter, you must request one via a Freshdesk ticket for each new safeguarded account you create.
</Callout>

{/* For e-money institutions (EMIs) and payment institutions (PIs), having at least one safeguarded account in place is a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requirement. */}

## Account types

### Client accounts

Client accounts are used if you're operating under CASS 7. This applies when providing your customers with investment services or certain types of ISA.

#### Designated Client Accounts
Also known as **Client Money Designated** accounts - are each used exclusively for a single named customer.

#### General Client Accounts
Also known as **Client Money Pooled** accounts - are pooled accounts that hold funds for one or more of your named clients. Virtual accounts can be created under this account type.

**Client accounts are safeguarded.**

### Segregated and Safeguarded accounts

Despite the name, both segregated and safeguarded accounts have the same level of customer protection.
However, the intended use of these two types is different:
* You should use segregated accounts if your institution Banks, Building Societies, and some Credit Unions.
* You should use safeguarded accounts if your institution is an Authorised Payment Institutions or an E-Money Institutions.

#### General Segregation/Safeguarding Accounts
Also known as **Segregated/Safeguarded Pooled** accounts - are pooled accounts that hold funds for one or more of your customers. Virtual accounts can be created under this account type.
{/* A **General Segregation Account** - also known as a **Segregated Pooled** account - holds funds pooled from multiple customers that need to be safeguarded. Segregation accounts should not be used to hold any of your institution's own funds. */}

#### Designated Segregation/Safeguarding Accounts
Also known as **Segregated/Safeguarded Designated** accounts - each hold funds for just one your customers.

**Both segregated and safeguarded accounts are safeguarded.**

### Other account types

#### Operating Account

Also known as a **Your Funds** account - holds your own operational funds: money that has been or will be transacted between your institution and ClearBank. This can include fees, interest earnings, and so on.

#### Bacs Suspense Account

Your **Bacs Suspense Account** is a special account primarily used to record transactions for returned payments. You do not need to deposit funds into it and you cannot initiate payments from it.

#### Mandated Minimum Balance Account

Your **Mandated Minimum Balance Account** holds your institution's pre-agreed mandatory minimum balance. Funds here are subject to the terms of your institution's contract with ClearBank.
