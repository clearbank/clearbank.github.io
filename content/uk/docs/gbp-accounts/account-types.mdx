## Overview

### Introduction

This page explains GBP accounts, their protections, . Embedded banking partners should see the [embedded banking documentation](/uk/docs/embedded-banking/retail-customers) for information about customer GBP accounts, which are FSCS protected.

When you join ClearBank, four financial accounts are given to you by default:

* An [Operating Account](#operating-account)
* A [General Segregation Account](#general-segregation-safeguarding-accounts)
* A [Bacs Suspense Account](#bacs-suspense-account)
* A [Mandated Minimum Balance Account](#mandated-minimum-balance-account)

You can create additional accounts of several types.

Your <strong>institution account</strong> is not a financial account: it is a digital representation of your institution with ClearBank. Through it you can access all your financial accounts. In this way, your institution account is a superset of all your financial accounts.

### Account protections

#### Segregation

Segregation separates your operational funds from customer funds. For certain types of institution, it is a regulatory requirement that customer funds are segregated from your institution's operational funds. Accounts created for this purpose are called segregated accounts.

You should be using segregated accounts if your institution is a Bank, Building Society, or a certain type of Credit Union.

#### Safeguarding

A safeguarded account is a type of segregated account, but is subject to different regulatory requirements to help keep customer money safe.

Safeguarded accounts do not have FSCS protection.

E-money institutions (EMIs) and payment institutions (PIs) must have at least one safeguarded account in place. This is a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requirement.

On request, ClearBank will provide safeguarding letters for each safeguarded account as proof of FCA regulatory compliance.

<Callout colour="blue">
An account is only safeguarded if you have received an FCA-compliant safeguarding letter from ClearBank. To receive this letter, you must request one via a Freshdesk ticket for each new safeguarded account you create.
</Callout>

#### FSCS

FSCS protected accounts are only available via embedded banking. See our [embedded banking documentation](/uk/docs/embedded-banking/retail-customers) for more information.

### Real accounts



### Virtual accounts

A virtual account held with ClearBank is a shadow of the actual virtual account held on your platform. Each virtual account is linked to a real **General** (also known as Pooled) account held at ClearBank.  
You can use a virtual account to send and receive payments by means of its association with this real account.  
You have complete control of virtual accounts, therefore the responsibility of managing and reconciling virtual account funds rests with you.

### Create a GBP account

Real (non-virtual) GBP accounts can be created using the **[POST /v3/Accounts endpoint](/uk/docs/gbp-accounts/manage-accounts#create-an-account-real)**.

You can specify the type of account using the **UsageType** field.  
The account type you choose should depend upon your agreement with ClearBank and the purpose of the account.

<Callout colour="blue">
An account's usage type is immutable. Take care to set the correct usage type when making a new account.
</Callout>

You can specify an account's name using the **AccountName** field.  
See the endpoint's documentation for accepted characters.

Account names are automatically prefixed with an abbreviated account-type label, for example:  
* An account is created with the following parameters:  
  * **AccountName**: 'johns savings'  
  * **UsageType**: 'Segregated Designated'

* When inspected using [**GET /v3/Accounts/{accountId}**](/uk/docs/gbp-accounts/manage-accounts#get-information-for-an-account-real), returns in the name field: `"Des Seg Wsale johns savings"`
