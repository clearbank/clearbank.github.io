## Overview

When you join ClearBank, you are given four financial accounts by default:

* An [Operating Account](#operating-account)
* A [General Segregation Account](#general-segregation-safeguarding-accounts)
* A [Bacs Suspense Account](#bacs-suspense-account)
* A [Mandated Minimum Balance Account](#mandated-minimum-balance-account)

<Callout colour="blue">
Your <strong>institution account</strong> is not a financial account: it is a digital representation of your institution with ClearBank. Through it you can access all your financial accounts. In this way, your institution account is a superset of all your financial accounts.
</Callout>

You can create additional Operating and General Segregation accounts.

### Create a GBP account

Real (non-virtual) GBP accounts can be created using the [POST /v3/Accounts endpoint](/uk/docs/gbp-accounts/manage-accounts#create-an-account-real).

You can specify the type of account using the **UsageType** field.  
The account type you choose should depend upon your agreement with ClearBank and the purpose of the account.

<Callout colour="blue">
An account's usage type is immutable. Take care to set the correct usage type when making a new account.
</Callout>

You can specify an account's name using the **AccountName** field. See the endpoint's documentation for accepted characters.  
Account names are automatically prefixed with an abbreviated account-type label.

For example:  
An account created with the following parameters:  
**AccountName**: 'johns savings'  
**UsageType**: 'Segregated Designated'

When inspected using [**GET /v3/Accounts/{accountId}**](/uk/docs/gbp-accounts/manage-accounts#get-information-for-an-account-real) will return the name field `"Des Seg Wsale johns savings"`


~~When you create a real account:~~

~~For sterling accounts - use the **UsageType** field to select YourFunds, SegregatedDesignated, or SegregatedPooled, as shown above. If you need to create a client account, first create a safeguarding account using the [POST /v3/Accounts](./manage-accounts#create-an-account-real), then contact client services through Freshdesk to get a safeguarding letter???.~~

~~For multi-currency accounts - use the **Kind** field to select YourFunds, DesignatedSegregated,  GeneralSegregated, DesignatedClient, or GeneralClient.~~

~~The UsageType or Kind value determines the autogenerated prefix assigned to the account, for example, 'Gen Seg Acc Retl'. The prefixes for each account are shown in the table below.~~

## Account protections

### Segregation

Segregation separates your operational funds from customer funds. For certain types of institution, it is a regulatory requirement that customer funds are segregated from your institution's operational funds. Accounts created for this purpose are called segregated accounts.

You should be using segregated accounts if your institution is a Bank, Building Society, or a certain type of Credit Union.

### Safeguarding

A safeguarded account is a type of segregated account, but is subject to different regulatory requirements to help keep customer money safe.

E-money institutions (EMIs) and payment institutions (PIs) must have at least one safeguarded account in place. This is a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requirement.

Safeguarded accounts do not have FSCS protection.

On request, ClearBank will provide safeguarding letters for each safeguarded account as proof of FCA regulatory compliance.

<Callout colour="blue">
An account is only safeguarded if you have received an FCA-compliant safeguarding letter from ClearBank. To receive this letter, you must request one via a Freshdesk ticket for each new safeguarded account you create.
