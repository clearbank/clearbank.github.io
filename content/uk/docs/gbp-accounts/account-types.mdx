## Overview

Several types of account can be created. The account-type you should use depends upon your agreement with ClearBank and the purpose of the account.

When you join ClearBank, you are given four financial accounts by default:

* Mandated Minimum Balance Account
* Bacs Suspense Account
* Operating Account
* General Segregation Account

Your **institution account** is not a financial account. It is a digital representation of your institution with ClearBank, and through it you can access all your financial accounts. In this way, all your financial accounts are 'within' your institution account.

 **Operating Accounts** - also known as **Your Funds** accounts - hold your own operational funds: money that has been or will be transacted between your institution and ClearBank. This can include fees, interest earnings, and so on.

 **General Segregation Accounts** - also known as **Segregated Pooled** accounts - hold funds pooled from multiple customers that need to be safeguarded. Segregation accounts should not be used to hold any of your institution's own funds.

 Your **Mandated Minimum Balance Account** holds your institution's pre-agreed mandatory minimum balance. Funds here are subject to the terms of your institution's contract with ClearBank.

 Your **Bacs Suspense Account** is a special account used to record transactions for returned payments. You do not need to deposit funds into it and you cannot initiate payments from it.

You can create additional operational and segregated accounts as needed. You can also create virtual accounts within a general segregation account or a general client account.

It is important to **select the correct usage for the account when you create it, as this cannot be amended later**. The account usage determines, for example, whether the account can be used for safeguarding funds.

When you create a real account:

- For sterling accounts - use the **UsageType** field to select YourFunds, SegregatedDesignated, or SegregatedPooled, as shown above. If you need to create a client account, first create a safeguarding account using the [POST /v3/Accounts](./manage-accounts#create-an-account-real), then contact client services through Freshdesk to have the type transferred to a client account.

- For multi-currency accounts - use the **Kind** field to select YourFunds, DesignatedSegregated,  GeneralSegregated, DesignatedClient, or GeneralClient. 

The UsageType or Kind value determines the autogenerated prefix assigned to the account, for example, 'Gen Seg Acc Retl'. The prefixes for each account are shown in the figure above.

- To create and manage sterling accounts, see [Manage sterling accounts](./manage-accounts).

### Safeguarded accounts

Safeguarding ensures that your customer's money is held separately from your operating funds. For e-money institutions (EMIs) and payment institutions (PIs), having at least one safeguarded account in place is a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requirement. ​

​You can receive an FCA-compliant safeguarding letter from ClearBank proving your regulatory compliance in relation to the account. Safeguarding gives your customers peace of mind knowing that their money would be protected if your business were to become insolvent, and all eligible funds are FSCS protected up to £85,000 across all accounts held at ClearBank.

If you require safeguarded accounts, you must raise a Freshdesk ticket to request a safeguarding letter once you have created a general segregation or designated segregation account. The account is only safeguarded if you have received a safeguarding letter from ClearBank.

### Client accounts

Client accounts are typically used if you’re operating under CASS 7. This applies when providing your customers with investment services or certain types of ISA.

These accounts separate customer funds from your institution's operating accounts. This allows you receive and hold money for or on behalf of your customers. By using this account type you protect customer funds and comply with regulatory requirements.

**Designated Client Accounts** - also known as Client Money Designated accounts - are each used exclusively for a single named client.

**General Client Accounts** - also known as Client Money Pooled accounts - are pooled accounts that hold funds for one or more of your named clients. Virtual accounts can be created under this account type.
