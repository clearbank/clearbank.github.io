## Real GBP accounts

A real account is a physical account held with ClearBank and can be used to send and/or receive payments.

**Before creating an account, please check which [account type](./account-types#account-types) you need.** If you are unsure, please get in touch.

The balance of a real account is also held by ClearBank and can be viewed via the Institution portal and the ClearBank API. Real accounts are reconciled for you by ClearBank.

## Virtual GBP accounts

Virtual accounts are held on your platform, but are linked to a real account held by ClearBank.  
To register a virtual account with ClearBank, you must link it to one of your real General - also known as Pooled - accounts held with ClearBank. You can then use the virtual account's Iban to send and receive payments using funds from the associated real account.

You are responsible for managing and reconciling your virtual accounts' balances.
