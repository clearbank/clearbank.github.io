## Real GBP accounts

A real account is a physical account held with ClearBank and can be used to send and/or receive payments.

**Before creating an account, please check which [account type](./account-types#account-types) you need.** If you are unsure, please get in touch.

The balance of a real account is also held by ClearBank and can be viewed via the Institution portal and the ClearBank API. Real accounts are reconciled for you by ClearBank.

## Virtual GBP accounts

**Virtual accounts are held on your platform, but their funds are kept in a real account held with ClearBank.**  
To create a virtual account with ClearBank, you must create it under one of your real general (also known as pooled) accounts. You can then use this account's virtual IBAN (vIBAN) to send and receive payments using funds from the associated real account.  
You can create virtual accounts using the **[POST /v2/Accounts/\{accountId\}/Virtual](#create-accounts-virtual)** endpoint.  

You are responsible for managing and reconciling your virtual accounts' balances.
