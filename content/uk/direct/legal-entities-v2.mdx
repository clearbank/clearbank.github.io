**Legal entities** are registered UK businesses. You can manage your legal entity customers' data with ClearBank directly as an embedded banking partner. Creating a legal entity is necessary before you can create a bank account for them.

Our legal entity endpoints allow you to:
* Store and retrieve key information about your business customers, such as their trading name, tax details, and business classification.
* Register non-account holders. Non-account holders are key individuals associated with the company - such as directors, controlling persons, and Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs).

### Compatible account types

Legal entities are eligible for certain account types, these include:
* [Savings accounts](../docs/embedded-banking/savings-accounts)
* [Hub accounts](../docs/embedded-banking/hub-accounts)
* Current Accounts

For more details on available account types, please reach out to your Client Director.

## Create, retrieve and update legal entities

When you create a legal entity, you include a variety of information about the company. This includes their KYC/AML data, `tradingName`, `annualRevenue`,  and `businessClassification`.

The `annualRevenue` you provide for a legal entities should be based on their previous year's revenue. If this is their first year of operation, an estimated value is acceptable.

You can specify the `businessClassification` details of a legal entity. Set their `businessClassification.sectorCode` and `industryClassification` according to the nature of their business.

## Legal entity's addresses

A legal entity can have both an active registered and trading address simultaneously, but no more than one of each. When you update a legal entity's address, their current address of the same type will automatically be changed to a previous address.

When a current address is replaced using this endpoint, it will be given an `validTo` date that matches the new address' `validFrom` date.

<EndpointBlock
  type="post"
  title="Update a legal entity's current address"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/addresses/current",
      version: "2.0-customers-legal-entity"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Legal entity's tax residencies

When you create a legal entity, you must specify at least one tax residency for them. You should specify all currently active tax residencies for a legal entity when you create them.

To change a legal entity's tax residency from one country to another, follow the below steps:
1. Add the new tax residency first. You can do this using the [**PUT /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/tax-residencies/{countryOfTaxResidence}**](#add-a-tax-residency-to-a-legal-entity) endpoint.
2. Delete the old tax residency. You can do this using the [**DELETE /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/tax-residencies/{countryOfTaxResidence}**](#delete-a-legal-entitys-tax-residency) endpoint.

**Note:** If a legal entity has only one tax residency, you must add a new tax residency before you can delete the current one. If you attempt to delete a legal entity's only tax residency you will receive a 422 - Unprocessable Entity error.

## Customer relation endpoints

The [**POST /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/related-parties**](#relate-a-legal-entity-and-another-entity) endpoint allows you to link two parties by providing their `customerId`s and specifying the nature of the relation.

**Note:** The arrangement of `customerId`s in the path parameter and the `relatedCustomerId` request field matters when creating a customer relation.  
The `customerId` in the path refers to the primary customer, while the `relatedCustomerId` refers to the customer which will have the specified relation (`relatedPartyType`) toward the primary customer.  
For example, when defining a UBO relationship, the customer referred to in the `relatedCustomerId` will become the Ultimate Beneficial Owner of the `customerId` specified in the path.

To retrieve all existing relations to a customer, you can call the [**GET /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/related-parties**](#get-all-relations-of-a-legal-entity).

To remove a relation between two parties, you can use the [**DELETE /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/related-parties/{relatedCustomerId}**](#delete-a-relation-between-two-entities) using the `customerId` of each party.
