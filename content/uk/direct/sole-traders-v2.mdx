**Sole traders** are natural persons operating a business in their own name. You can manage your sole traders' data with ClearBank directly as an embedded banking partner. Creating a sole trader is necessary before you can create accounts for them.

The data required to register a sole trader is a combination of fields associated with both legal entities (incorporated businesses) and [retail customers](../docs/embedded-banking/retail-customers). This is because a sole trader is simultaneously an individual and a business. For example: a sole trader has both an individual's personal details - such as a `firstName`, and details of their business such as a `tradingName`.

### Compatible account types

Sole traders are eligible for certain account types, these include:
* [Savings accounts](../docs/embedded-banking/savings-accounts)
* [Hub accounts](../docs/embedded-banking/hub-accounts)
* [Cash ISAs](../docs/embedded-banking/flexible-cash-isa)
* Current Accounts

For more details on available account types, please reach out to your Client Director.

## Create, update and retrieve a sole trader

#### Business information

In addition to a sole trader's personal details, you can provide information about their business. This includes their `tradingName`, `annualRevenue`, and `businessClassification`.

A sole trader can use their personal name as their `tradingName`, or instead pick a business name. Guidance on acceptable business names for sole traders can be found on the <ExternalLink href="https://www.gov.uk/become-sole-trader/choose-your-business-name">gov.uk</ExternalLink> website.

The `annualRevenue` you provide for a sole traders should be based on their previous year's revenue. If this is their first year of operation, an estimated value is acceptable.

You can specify the `businessClassification` details of a sole trader. Their `businessClassification.sectorCode` should always be `_8b_UnincorporatedBusinessesOtherThanLLPs`, while their `industryClassification` should be the option that most closely fits their business.

#### Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) fields

When you create a sole trader, you'll need to provide the outcomes of any KYC and AML checks you conduct on them. You can record these outcomes using the `kycAml` object. Guidance for each of the object's properties are listed below:
* `sanctions` - If your KYC checks identify the customer as sanctioned, set to `true`.
* `pep` - If your checks identify the customer as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP), set to `Yes_Domestic` or `Yes_International` accordingly - otherwise set to `No`.
* `rca` - If your checks identify the customer as a Relative or Close Associate (RCA) of a PEP, set to `Yes_Domestic` or `Yes_International` accordingly - otherwise set to `No`.
* `craRating` - Use this field to declare a Customer Risk Assessment rating for the customer. There are four tiers of risk: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, and `Very_High`.

If you have new KYC or AML outcomes for a customer, you can update these using the [**PATCH /customers/v2/sole-traders/{customerId}**](#update-a-sole-trader) endpoint.

#### Addresses

When you create a sole trader, you'll also need to provide their current residential and/or trading address in the `addressHistory.currentAddresses` array. You can optionally record their previous address history using the `addressHistory.previousAddresses` array.

    }
  ]}

  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/customers/v2/customers/{customerId}",
      version: "2.0-customers-sole-trader"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Sole trader addresses

When you create a sole trader, you'll need to provide their current residential and/or trading address in the `addressHistory.currentAddresses` array. You can optionally record their previous address history via the `addressHistory.previousAddresses` array.

A sole trader can have more than one current address by having both a residential and trading address, but no more than one of each.

You can update a sole trader's current residential or trading address using the [**POST /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/current-addresses**](#update-a-sole-traders-current-addresses) endpoint. When you do this, the sole trader's current address of that type - either residential or trading address - will be automatically moved to the `previousAddresses` array, and will have a `validTo` date set to the new address' `validFrom` date. If you do not specify a `validFrom` date for the new address, it will default to today's date.

It is not currently possible to delete a previous address.

<EndpointBlock
  type="post"
  title="Update a sole trader's current addresses"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/current-addresses",
      version: "2.0-customers-sole-trader"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Sole trader ID document endpoints

Similar to retail customers, you can optionally provide identity document information for sole traders. For example, you can provide a sole trader's passport number `idNumber` and date of expiry `idExpiryDate` in the `identityDocuments` array in the [**POST /customers/v2/sole-traders**](#create-a-sole-trader) endpoint.

If you provide customer identity information, you must always include its `idCountryOfIssue`, `idType`, `idNumber`, and `idExpiryDate`. The combination of `idCountryOfIssue` and `idType` uniquely identifies a customer's identity documents in our APIs. You can therefore only provide one `idCountryOfIssue` and `idType` combination per sole trader.

To update or delete an existing identity information, use the [**PUT /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/identity-documents/{idCountryOfIssue}-{idType}**](#update-a-sole-traders-id-document) or [**DELETE /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/identity-documents/{idCountryOfIssue}-{idType}**](#delete-a-sole-traders-id-document) endpoint accordingly.

There is currently no facility to upload images of customer ID documents.

<EndpointBlock
  type="put"
  title="Update a sole trader's ID document"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/identity-documents/{idCountryOfIssue}-{idType}",
      version: "2.0-customers-sole-trader"
    }
  ]}
/>

<EndpointBlock
  type="delete"
  title="Delete a sole trader's ID document"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/identity-documents/{idCountryOfIssue}-{idType}",
      version: "2.0-customers-sole-trader"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Tax residency endpoints

When you create a sole trader, you must specify at least one tax residency for them. A customer can have dual tax residency in certain situations, such as if they live in one country but earn income in another. You should specify all currently active tax residencies for a sole trader when you create them.

US citizens are generally considered to be US tax residents regardless of where they live.

To change a sole trader's tax residency from one country to another, follow the below steps:
1. Add the new tax residency first. You can do this using the [**PUT /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/tax-residencies/{countryOfTaxResidence}**](#add-a-tax-residency-to-a-sole-trader) endpoint.
2. Delete the old tax residency. You can do this using the [**DELETE /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/tax-residencies/{countryOfTaxResidence}**](#delete-a-sole-traders-tax-residency) endpoint.

**Note:** If a customer has only one tax residency, you must add a new tax residency before you can delete the current one. If you attempt to delete a sole trader's only tax residency you will receive a 422 - Unprocessable Entity error.

<EndpointBlock
  type="put"
  title="Add a tax residency to a sole trader"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/tax-residencies/{countryOfTaxResidence}",
      version: "2.0-customers-sole-trader"
    }
  ]}
/>

<EndpointBlock
  type="delete"
  title="Delete a sole trader's tax residency"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/tax-residencies/{countryOfTaxResidence}",
      version: "2.0-customers-sole-trader"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Customer relation endpoints

The [**POST /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/related-parties**](#relate-a-sole-trader-and-another-entity) endpoint allows you to link two parties by providing their `customerId` and specifying the nature of the relation.

**Note:** The arrangement of `customerId` in the path parameter and the `relatedCustomerId` request field matters when creating a customer relation.  
The `customerId` in the path refers to the primary customer, while the `relatedCustomerId` refers to the customer which will have the specified relation (`relatedPartyType`) toward the primary customer.  
For example, when defining a UBO relationship, the customer referred to in the `relatedCustomerId` will become the Ultimate Beneficial Owner of the `customerId` specified in the path.

To retrieve all existing relations to a customer, you can call the [**GET /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/related-parties**](#get-all-relations-of-a-sole-trader-customer).

To remove a relation between two parties, you can use the [**DELETE /customers/v2/customers/{customerId}/related-parties/{relatedCustomerId}**](#delete-a-relation-between-two-customers) using the `customerId` of each party.
