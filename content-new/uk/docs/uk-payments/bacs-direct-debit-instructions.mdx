## Direct Debit Instructions

A Direct Debit Instruction (DDI) is an authorisation to collect future payments from a nominated account.
A DDI can be submitted to ClearBank by service users in two ways:
- Electronically via the Bacs Automated Direct Debit Instruction Service (AUDDIS), or,
- Sent as a paper instruction to your address to be entered via the ClearBank API after you have validated it.

A DDI can be set up against a real or virtual account held with ClearBank. It cannot be set up against a General Segregated Account, your Bacs Suspense Account, or your Minimum Mandated Balance account. You will receive the [Bacs Mandate Initiated webhook](./webhooks/#bacs-mandate-initiated-webhook) once the DDI is present in our system.

If you are transferring an existing sort code to ClearBank that already has DDIs set up, you will need to use the API to inform us of these.

Once a DDI has been set up against an account via AUDDIS, payments may be collected from the account from the third day; for paper instructions, payments may be collected from the following day.
The timing of the payment is in the control of the service user and does not necessarily follow immediately.

To receive feedback during DDI management, subscribe to the relevant webhooks which are listed here: [BACS DDI webhooks](./webhooks/#bacs-direct-debit-instructions).

**Note**: Occasionally you might receive a [Bacs Mandate Cancellation Failed webhook](./webhooks/#bacs-mandate-cancellation-failed-webhook), after having cancelled a Direct Debit Instruction through the `DELETE` endpoints.  This does not necessarily mean a real failure. This situation can arise as in the following example:<br/>

An end-customer cancels their phone contract with "FabuPhone". FabuPhone immediately cancel the DDI through the Bacs system. The end-customer also requests that you cancel the DDI, and you attempt to do so using the `DELETE` endpoint. As the instruction was already cancelled, it no longer exists and cannot be found. You will then receive a Bacs Mandate Cancellation Failed webhook.<br/> 
You can use the `GET endpoint (GET /{vn}/Accounts/{accountId}/Mandates)` to check the DDIs in place for the account and verify that everything is as it should be.

### Dormant Direct Debit Instructions

Please note that ClearBank also performs weekly dormancy checks on Direct Debit Instructions set up against your accounts. After a set period of inactivity against a DDI, the instruction will be marked as **Cancelled** and further payment will not be processed.

By default, a DDI must be dormant for 24 months before it is automatically flagged for cancellation. However, this period can be extended by the service user in agreement with their sponsor bank. ClearBank uses the current value from the latest Direct Debit Originator (DDO) Database maintained by Pay.UK when we run the dormancy check.

If a Direct Debit is cancelled due to dormancy but is still required, the service user will need to arrange to send a new instruction.

## Bacs DDI webhooks

The following webhooks relate to managing Direct Debit Instructions. The webhooks can occur in response to an endpoint (as detailed below) but also if we receive a DDI from the Bacs payment service. The webhooks returned are the same regardless of whether a real or virtual account endpoint is used. Note that the webhook names include the term "mandate". This reflects the code, but should be understood to mean "Direct Debit Instruction".

<WebhookSummary
  description='Create a DDI for a real account'
  endpoint='/bacs-direct-debits/#create-ddi-for-a-real-account'
  method='post'
  webhooks={[
    'bacs-mandate-initiated-webhook-v2',
    'bacs-mandate-initiation-failed-webhook-v1'
  ]}
/>


<WebhookSummary
  description='Cancel a DDI for a real or virtual account'
  endpoint='/bacs-direct-debits/#cancel-a-ddi-for-a-real-account'
  method='delete'
  webhooks={[
    'bacs-mandate-cancelled-webhook-v2',
    'bacs-mandate-cancellation-failed-webhook-v1'
  ]}
/>


<WebhookSummary

  method='post'
  webhooks={[
    'bacs-mandate-returned-webhook-v1',
    'bacs-mandate-return-failed-webhook-v1'
  ]}
/>

You may also receive a [Bacs Mandate Migrated webhook](#bacs-mandate-migrated-webhook) which is prompted by information received from Bacs.

<WebhookPlaceholder render='bacs-mandate-initiation-failed-webhook-v1' />
