## Savings accounts

ClearBank supports savings accounts. If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your relationship manager.

You can choose how much interest to pay customers. ClearBank will then calculate the daily accruals and post the monthly interest payments.

To create a savings account, use the [POST /v1/savings](#create-a-savings-account) endpoint. You must also set a nominated account using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint.

<Callout colour="blue">
A <strong>nominated account</strong> is the account that you transfer funds from, and any remaining funds and interest will be transferred into upon closure of the savings account.
</Callout>

![Submit the POST /v1/savings endpoint. Once you receive a 201 response, submit the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account to set up a nominated account. Once you receive a 200 response, funds can now be added to the savings account.](/assets/images/savings-account-open.svg)

Once you have opened a savings account, you can submit and withdraw payments using the usual payment endpoints.

      path: "/v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account",
      version: "1.0.Sterling",
    }
  ]}
/>

## Closing a savings account

To close a savings account, use the [POST /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#close-a-savings-account) endpoint. The process is asynchronous. Accrued interest, if any, will be deposited into the nominated account.
