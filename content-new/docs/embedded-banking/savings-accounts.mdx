## Savings accounts

ClearBank supports savings accounts. A savings account is an FSCS-protected account that can? accrue interest on behalf of a customer. If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your relationship manager.

You can choose how much interest to pay customers. ClearBank will calculate accruals and post regular interest payments.

- If you would like to create a customer current account, refer to [Business banking customer accounts](./business-banking-customer-accounts).

**To create a savings account:**
1. If not already present, create a retail customer using the [Create a retail customer](./manage-retail-customers) endpoint.
2. Use the [POST /v1/savings](#create-a-savings-account) endpoint to create the account.
3. Set the nominated account using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint.
> A <strong>nominated account</strong> is the account that accrued interest, if any, will be transferred into upon closure of the savings account. Name matching between accounts is your responsibility.

![Submit the POST /v1/savings endpoint. Once you receive a 201 response, submit the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account to set up a nominated account. Once you receive a 200 response, funds can now be added to the savings account.](/assets/images/savings-account-open.svg)

<Callout colour="blue">
Always note down the X-Request-Id when creating an account. If you receive a 500 response when submitting to the endpoint, resubmitting the request with the same X-Request-Id will avoid creating a duplicate account.
</Callout>

Once you have opened a savings account, you can deposit and withdraw payments using the Faster Payments or CHAPS payment endpoints. Incoming or outgoing Bacs payments are not accepted.

**To close a savings account:**
1. Withdraw all funds from the account.
2. Verify that a nominated account has been defined.
3. Use the [POST /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#close-a-savings-account) endpoint.
> The process is asynchronous. Unpaid accrued interest, if any, will be deposited into the nominated account.
4. OPTIONAL Check closure status using the [GET /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#get-account-closure-status) endpoint.
5. The [Account Closure Completed webhook](#account-closure-completed-webhook) will be sent once the account has closed.

Webhooks are not instant and may take up to the following day to arrive. Wait until you recieve a webhook before trying to close the account again.

Account closure may fail due to the nominated account details being incorrect. You will know from the `ClosureFailureReason` field in the Account Closure Failed webhook.

**To close the account :**
1. Correct the nominated account details using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint.
3. Use the [POST /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#close-a-savings-account) endpoint.
> The process is asynchronous. Unpaid accrued interest, if any, will be deposited into the nominated account.
4. OPTIONAL Check closure status using the [GET /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#get-account-closure-status) endpoint.
5. The [Account Closure Completed webhook](#account-closure-completed-webhook) will be sent once the account has closed.
