## Savings accounts

ClearBank supports savings accounts. If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your relationship manager.

You can choose how much interest to pay customers. ClearBank will then calculate the daily accruals and post the monthly interest payments.

To create a savings account, first use the [POST /v1/savings](#create-a-savings-account) endpoint, then set the nominated account using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint.

<Callout colour="blue">
A <strong>nominated account</strong> is the account that any remaining funds and interest will be transferred into upon closure of the savings account.
</Callout>

![Submit the POST /v1/savings endpoint. Once you receive a 201 response, submit the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account to set up a nominated account. Once you receive a 200 response, funds can now be added to the savings account.](/assets/images/savings-account-open.svg)

Once you have opened a savings account, you can deposit and withdraw payments using the usual payment endpoints.

To close a savings account, use the [POST /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#close-a-savings-account) endpoint. The process is asynchronous. Accrued interest, if any, will be deposited into the nominated account.

You can optionally check closure status using the [GET /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#get-account-closure-status) endpoint.

If the account closure fails, it may be because the nominated account details are incorrect. Before contacting ClearBank, re-enter the nominated account details using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint, then re-call the [GET /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#get-account-closure-status) endpoint.

<Callout colour="blue">
Webhooks are not instant and may take up to the following day to arrive. Wait until you recieve a webhook to try again.
