## Savings accounts

ClearBank supports savings accounts. If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your relationship manager.

You can choose how much interest to pay customers. ClearBank will calculate accruals and post regular interest payments.

<Callout colour="blue">
To create a savings account, you must have first created a retail customer using the <a href="../embedded-banking/manage-retail-customers#create-a-retail-customer">Create a retail customer</a> endpoint.
</Callout>

To create a savings account, first use the [POST /v1/savings](#create-a-savings-account) endpoint, then set the nominated account using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint.

<Callout colour="blue">
A <strong>nominated account</strong> is the account that accrued interest, if any, will be transferred into upon closure of the savings account. Name matching between accounts is your responsiblity.
</Callout>

![Submit the POST /v1/savings endpoint. Once you receive a 201 response, submit the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account to set up a nominated account. Once you receive a 200 response, funds can now be added to the savings account.](/assets/images/savings-account-open.svg)

<Callout colour="blue">
Always note down the X-Request-Id when creating an account. If you receive a 500 response when submitting to the endpoint, resubmitting the request with the same X-Request-Id will let you know whether the account has already been created.
</Callout>

Once you have opened a savings account, you can deposit and withdraw payments using the Faster Payments or CHAPS payment endpoints. Incoming or outgoing Bacs payments are not accepted.

To close a savings account, you must first withdraw all funds before using the [POST /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#close-a-savings-account) endpoint to close the account. The process is asynchronous. Unpaid accrued interest, if any, will be deposited into the nominated account.

You can optionally check closure status using the [GET /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#get-account-closure-status) endpoint.

![To close an account, set the nominated account using the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account endpoint. Once you receive a 200 response, submit the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account to set up a nominated account. Once you receive a 200 response, funds can now be added to the savings account.](/assets/images/savings-account-close.svg)

Account closure may fail due to the nominated account details being incorrect. You will know from `ClosureFailureReason` field in the Account Closure Failed webhook. Re-enter the nominated account details using the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint, then re-call the [GET /v1/accounts/{id}/closure](#get-account-closure-status) endpoint.
