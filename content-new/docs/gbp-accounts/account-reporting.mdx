## Statements

You can request a statement containing all payment activity across your ClearBank accounts for the previous business day, also referred to as a 'Bank to Customer Statement'. The statement is delivered in an ISO 20022 compliant XML file known as camt.053 (Cash Management message).

The statement is populated with transaction activity across all of your accounts within the time range given. Note that a transaction must be in a **Settled** state to be included. Your statement request must contain a **startDateTime** and **endDateTime** which will be validated against the fo:
- The difference between the startDateTime and endDateTime must be less than or equal to 25 hours
- The startDateTime must be within the last 6 months
- The endDateTime must be in the past


### Note the following regarding statement generation:
- ClearBank complete internal reconciliation for the previous business day in the early hours of the morning and will respond to requests to generate a statement for that period once reconciliation is complete. 
- The time taken to generate a statement may vary depending on the number of accounts or number of settled transactions included in the request.
- The statement will be divided into pages and assigned a **PageNumber** value (1 page contains 10,000 transaction records).
- Once generated, statements are available to download for 2 weeks.
 
Once the statement has been generated, you will receive a Statements.ReadyForDownload (confirm name) webhook containing a unique **MessageId** and a **TotalPages** value.
Use the GET /v1/statements{messageId} endpoint and provide a **PageNumber** value to retrieve that page of the statement. Note that only one page can be retrieved per GET request.

## How to download your statement
We respond to valid GET statement calls with a **200 OK** response which contains an **XMLObject**. This object contains the requested page of the camt.053 statement in XML format.

If the **TotalPages** value in the Statements.ReadyForDownload webhook is greater than 1, repeat the GET call until:
- **PageNumber** value in the GET call is equal to **TotalPages** value in the webhook, or 
- **LastPageIndicator** in the Group Header of the XML is true (confirm if the value is 'true' or '1')

If you request a statement for a time range where there have been no settled transactions, you will still receive a Statements.ReadyForDownload webhook with a **TotalPages** value of **1** and a valid **MessageId**. The download will contain a blank statement.

## Joel to confirm:
## Intraday - If the current date is requested, do we return what we have up to that point or generate it next day
