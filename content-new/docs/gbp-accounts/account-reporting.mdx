## Statements

You can request a statement containing all payment activity across your ClearBank accounts for a completed business day, also referred to as a 'Bank to Customer Statement'. The statement is delivered in an ISO 20022 compliant XML file known as camt.053 (Cash Management message).

The statement is populated with transaction activity across all of your accounts within a given time range. Note that a transaction must be in a **Settled** state to be included. The **startDateTime** and **endDateTime** in your statement request must:
- be less than or equal to 25 hours apart
- be within the last 6 months (for example, on 1 July 2024, you can request transaction data back to and including 1 January 2024)
- be in the past

<Callout colour="blue">
We complete internal reconciliation for the previous business day in the early hours of the morning and will generate a statement for that period once reconciliation is complete (intraday statements are not available).
</Callout>

### How to request and download your statement
Use the **POST /v1/statementrequests** endpoint to request the generation of a camt.053 statement for a specific time range.

The process is shown in this message flow diagram:

<br />
<br />

![Image showing camt.053 statement message flow](/assets/images/camt053-message-flow.svg "camt.053 statement request message flow")

<br />

Once the statement has been generated, you will receive a **Statements Ready For Download** webhook containing a unique **MessageId** and a **TotalPages** value. The statement is divided into pages and each page is assigned a **PageNumber** value. If a page reaches the maximum number of transactions (5000), the statement is continued on a new page. Each page is a complete XML file starting with a group header. 

<Callout colour="blue">
The time taken to generate a statement varies depending on the number of settled transactions included in the request. 
Once generated, statements are retained for 2 weeks.
</Callout>

To download a statement page, use the **GET /v1/statements/{messageId}** and provide the unique **MessageID** contained in the webhook and the **PageNumber** you wish to download. You can only download one statement page per request. If the generated statement contains multiple pages and you wish to download them all, repeat the GET call with an incremented page number until:
- **PageNumber** is equal to the **TotalPages** value in the webhook, or, 
- **LastPageIndicator** in the Group Header of the XML is **true**

We'll respond to the GET statement call with a **200 OK** response containing an **XMLObject**. This object contains the requested page of the camt.053 statement in XML format. The start of the statement page can be identified by the XML group header which will be in this format:
