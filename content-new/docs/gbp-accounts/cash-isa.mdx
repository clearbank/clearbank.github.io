## Cash ISAs overview

A cash ISA (Individual Savings Account) is a real savings deposit account held with ClearBank that is subject to tax benefits [defined by the UK government](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts). It can be used to send and/or receive payments once a **nominated account** has also been defined.

The balance of a real account is held by ClearBank and can be viewed via the ClearBank Portal and our API. Real accounts are reconciled for you by ClearBank.

<Callout colour="blue">
A <strong>nominated account</strong> is the account that any remaining funds and interest will be transferred into upon closure of the cash ISA.
</Callout>

Because cash ISAs are structured differently to other account types, you will need to use the endpoints defined on this page to interact with them. Do not use the endpoints listed on the [Manage sterling acounts page](./manage-accounts).

### Open and close cash ISAs

To set up a cash ISA:

1. Use the [POST /v1/isas](#create-an-cash-isa) endpoint to create the account
2. Use the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint to define the nominated account for the cash ISA
> You cannot deposit money into the cash ISA before the nominated account has been defined.

![Submit the POST /v1/isas endpoint. Once you receive a 201 response, submit the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account to set up a nominated account. Once you receive a 200 response, funds can now be added to the cash ISA.](/assets/images/open-a-cash-isa.svg)

To close a cash ISA:
1. Use the [POST /v1/isas/{accountId}/cancellation](#close-a-cash-isa) endpoint to request the account closure. 
> This process is asynchronous. Once the request is accepted, the account will remain open until the last interest payment is calculated and paid. This interest payment will be made to the nominated account. Once the payment has completed, the account will be closed.
2. OPTIONAL Use the [GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#check-cash-isa-closure-status) endpoint to check whether the account has been closed.
3. You will receive either the Account Closure Completed or Account Closure Failed webhook once the account closure process has completed.

![Submit the POST /v1/isas/{accountId}/cancellation endpoint. Once you receive a 202 response. As the process is asynchronous, you can check on the closure status using the GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure endpoint. Once the closure is confirmed, you will receive either the Account Closure Completed or Account Closure Failed webhook.](/assets/images/close-a-cash-isa.svg)

### Manage cash ISAs

You can manage the majority of the tasks you need to complete for cash ISAs through our API. 

Use these endpoints to:
- Get information on a cash ISA
- Get information on a nominated account
- Cancel a cash ISA application (cancellation must occur within x days after requesting a cash ISA creation and before it is funded)
- Set an eligibility flag for cash ISAs for a named customer
- Transfer a cash ISA to another provider
