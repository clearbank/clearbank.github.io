## Cash ISAs overview

A cash ISA (Individual Savings Account) is a real savings deposit account held with ClearBank that is subject to tax benefits [defined by the UK government](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts). It can be used to send and/or receive payments once a **nominated account** has also been defined.

<Callout colour="blue">
A <strong>nominated account</strong> is the account that any remaining funds and interest will be transferred into upon closure of the cash ISA.
</Callout>

The balance of a real account is held by ClearBank and can be viewed only via our API. Real accounts are reconciled for you by ClearBank. To open a cash ISA, your customer must provide you with their national insurance number.

Because cash ISAs are structured differently to other account types, you will need to use the endpoints defined on this page to interact with them. Do not use the endpoints listed on the [Manage sterling acounts page](./manage-accounts).

## Set up a cash ISA

When creating a new cash ISA, you need to first create the account, then set up the nominated account.

To set up a cash ISA:

1. Use the [POST /v1/isas](#create-an-cash-isa) endpoint to create the account
> You cannot deposit funds into the cash ISA before the nominated account has been defined. 
2. Use the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint to define the nominated account for the cash ISA
> You can now deposit funds into the cash ISA.

The process is shown in this message flow diagram:

![Submit the POST /v1/isas endpoint. Once you receive a 201 response, submit the PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account to set up a nominated account. Once you receive a 200 response, funds can now be added to the cash ISA.](/assets/images/cash-isa-open.svg)

The account is now open and fully operational. You can return details of a cash ISA using the [GET /v1/isas/{accountId}](#get-cash-isa-details) endpoint.

## End of life for a cash ISA

There are several ways you can close a cash ISA. You need to choose the appropriate one based on what's happened in the account journey so far and what the customer wants to do with the account next.

| Action | What this does |
|---------|------------|
| Close | Closes the account. |
| Cancel | Cancels and closes the account without registering the account with the UK government. |
| Transfer out | Allows you to transfer the account to another provider. You then need to close the account. |

You can use this diagram to select the correct action:

The sections below explain how to:
- [Close a cash ISA](#close)
- [Cancel a cash ISA](#cancel)
- [Transfer out a cash ISA](#transfer-out)

### Close
When closing a cash ISA, you must first withdraw funds before closing the account.

<Callout colour="blue">
If the cash ISA is under 14 days old and has had money deposited, use the <a href="#cancel-a-cash-isa">cancel a cash ISA</a> endpoint instead.
</Callout>

Before an account closure can be requested, any interest accrued will be paid and the account balance must be zero. Funds can be withdrawn to a nominated account or another ClearBank account.

If the account balance is not zero, the request will be rejected. **Account closure requests cannot be undone.**

To close a cash ISA:
1. Withdraw all funds from the cash ISA.
2. Use the [POST /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#close-a-cash-isa) endpoint to request the account closure. 
> This process is asynchronous. Once the request is accepted, the account will remain open until the last interest payment is calculated and paid. This interest payment will be made to the nominated account. Once the payment has completed, the account will be closed.
3. OPTIONAL Use the [GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#check-cash-isa-closure-status) endpoint to check whether the account has been closed.
4. You will receive either the Account Closure Completed or Account Closure Failed webhook once the account closure process has completed.

The process is shown in this message flow diagram:

![Submit the POST /v1/isas/{accountId}/cancellation endpoint. Once you receive a 202 response. As the process is asynchronous, you can check on the closure status using the GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure endpoint. Once the closure is confirmed, you will receive either the Account Closure Completed or Account Closure Failed webhook.](/assets/images/cash-isa-close.svg)

### Cancel
When cancelling a cash ISA, the account must be under fourteen days old. This endpoint also closes the account.

The cancellation period is based on the acceptance date field. For example, an account with the acceptance date of the 1st of the month can be cancelled up to 23:59 on the 14th day of the month.

Money must have already been deposited into the cash ISA. If no money has been deposited, or the account is over 14 days old, use the <a href="#close-a-cash-isa">POST /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure</a> endpoint instead.

To cancel a cash ISA:
1. Withdraw all funds from the cash ISA.
2. Use the [POST /v1/isas/{accountId}/cancellation](#cancel-a-cash-isa) to request the cancellation.
> This process is asynchronous. Once the request is accepted, the account will remain open until the last interest payment is calculated and paid. This interest payment will be made to the nominated account. Once the payment has completed, the account will be cancelled.
3. OPTIONAL Use the [GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#check-cash-isa-closure-status) endpoint to check whether the account has been closed.
4. You will receive either the Account Closure Completed or Account Closure Failed webhook once the account closure process has completed.

The process is shown in this message flow diagram:

### Transfer out
You can also transfer a cash ISA to another provider. Once the transfer is successful and the waiting period has completed, you'll need to close the account using the [POST /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#close-a-cash-isa) endpoint.

While you can transfer out an account during the 14 day grace period after opening an account, we recommend to close the account and move the funds. Closing an account is faster than a transfer, and the customer will not lose their tax liability.

During the transfer process, you move funds to a transfer out account created during onboarding. If the transfer out is successful, you can then move the funds from the transfer out account to the new provider's account. If the transfer out fails, the new provider will return funds to the transfer account. You can then recredit this to the cash ISA and the account will continue to exist.

There is a mandatory 15 day waiting period. If you requested an account closure on the 1st of the month, the waiting period ends at 00:00 on the 16th. After that, you can close the account.

To transfer out a cash ISA:
1. Use the [POST /v1/isas/{accountId}/transfer-outs](#transfer-out-a-cash-ISA).
> The cash ISA is now frozen. Only interest will be credited to the account, and only a full withdrawal can be withdrawn from the account.
2. Once the account has been credited the final interest payment, withdraw the full balance of the account to the transfer out account created during onboarding. ClearBank will send the transfer history form to the new ISA provider.
3. Wait at least the remainder of the 15 working day waiting period to ensure the transfer out has been successful.
4. Once the transfer has successfully completed, use the [POST /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#close-a-cash-isa) endpoint to request the account closure.
5. OPTIONAL Use the [GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#check-cash-isa-closure-status) endpoint to check whether the account has been closed.
6. You will receive either the Account Closure Completed or Account Closure Failed webhook once the account closure process has completed.

The process is shown in this message flow diagram:
