## Cash ISAs overview

A cash ISA (Individual Savings Account) is a real savings deposit account held with ClearBank that is subject to tax benefits [defined by the UK government](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts). It can be used to send and/or receive payments once a **nominated account** has also been defined.

<Callout colour="blue">
A <strong>nominated account</strong> is the account that any remaining funds and interest will be transferred into upon closure of the cash ISA.
</Callout>

The balance of a real account is held by ClearBank and can be viewed only via our API. Real accounts are reconciled for you by ClearBank.

Because cash ISAs are structured differently to other account types, you will need to use the endpoints defined on this page to interact with them. Do not use the endpoints listed on the [Manage sterling acounts page](./manage-accounts).

## Set up a cash ISA

To set up a cash ISA:

1. Use the [POST /v1/isas](#create-an-cash-isa) endpoint to create the account
2. Use the [PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/nominated-account](#set-up-a-nominated-account) endpoint to define the nominated account for the cash ISA
> You cannot deposit money into the cash ISA before the nominated account has been defined.

    }
  ]}

## Closing a cash ISA

If the cash ISA is under 14 days old, use the [cancel a cash ISA](#cancel-a-cash-ISA) endpoint instead.

Before an account closure can be requested, any interest accrued must be paid and the account balance must be 0. Funds can be withdrawn to a nominated account or another ClearBank account.

If the account balance is not 0, the request will be rejected. Account closure requests cannot be undone.

To close a cash ISA:
1. Use the [POST /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#close-a-cash-isa) endpoint to request the account closure. 
> This process is asynchronous. Once the request is accepted, the account will remain open until the last interest payment is calculated and paid. This interest payment will be made to the nominated account. Once the payment has completed, the account will be closed.
2. OPTIONAL Use the [GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#check-cash-isa-closure-status) endpoint to check whether the account has been closed.
3. You will receive either the Account Closure Completed or Account Closure Failed webhook once the account closure process has completed.

![Submit the POST /v1/isas/{accountId}/cancellation endpoint. Once you receive a 202 response.

## Manage a cash ISA

You can manage the majority of the tasks you need to complete for cash ISAs through our API. 

Use these endpoints to:
- Get information on a cash ISA
- Set an eligibility flag for cash ISAs for a named customer

<EndpointBlock
  type="get"
  title="Get cash ISA details"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/v1/isas/{accountId}",
      version: "1.0.Sterling",
    }
  ]}
/>

<EndpointBlock
  type="put"
  title="Set customer as ineligible"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/v1/isas/{accountId}/customer-eligibility",
      version: "1.0.Sterling",
    }
  ]}
/>

## Cancelling a cash ISA

Cash ISAs can be cancelled within 14 days of account creation. The endpoint both cancels and closes the account.

**The cancellation grace period is based on the acceptance date field. For example, an account with created on the 1st of the month can be cancelled up to 23:59 on the 14th day of the month.**

**To cancel the ISA, money must have already been deposited into the account.** If no money has been deposited, or the account is over 14 days old, use the [POST /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#close-a-cash-isa) endpoint instead.

To cancel a cash ISA, within 14 days of account opening:
1. Withdraw all funds from the cash ISA.
2. Use the [POST /v1/isas/{accountId}/cancellation](#cancel-a-cash-isa) to request the cancellation.
> This process is asynchronous. Once the request is accepted, the account will remain open until the last interest payment is calculated and paid. This interest payment will be made to the nominated account. Once the payment has completed, the account will be cancelled.
3. OPTIONAL Use the [GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#check-cash-isa-closure-status) endpoint to check whether the account has been closed.
4. You will receive either the Account Closure Completed or Account Closure Failed webhook once the account closure process has completed.

## Transferring out a cash ISA

Cash ISAs can be transferred to another provider.

To transfer out a cash ISA:
1. Use the [POST /v1/isas/{accountId}/transfer-outs](#transfer-out-a-cash-ISA).
> The cash ISA is now frozen. Only interest will be credited to the account, and only a full withdrawal can be debited from the account.
2. Once you have credited the final interest payment, withdraw the full balance of the account to the transfer hub created during onboarding. ClearBank will send the transfer history form to the new ISA provider.
3. Wait at least the remainder of the 15 working day waiting period from account closure to ensure the transfer has been successful. **If you requested an account closure on the 1st of the month, the waiting period ends at midnight on the 16th.**
4. Once the transfer has successfully completed, use the [POST /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#close-a-cash-isa) endpoint to request the account closure.
> This process is asynchronous. Once the request is accepted, the account will remain open until the last interest payment is calculated and paid. This interest payment will be made to the nominated account. Once the payment has completed, the account will be closed.
5. OPTIONAL Use the [GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/closure](#check-cash-isa-closure-status) endpoint to check whether the account has been closed.
6. You will receive either the Account Closure Completed or Account Closure Failed webhook once the account closure process has completed.
