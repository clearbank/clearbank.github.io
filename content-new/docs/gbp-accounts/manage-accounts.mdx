## Real GBP accounts

A real account is a physical account held with ClearBank and can be used to send and/or receive payments.

**Before creating an account, please ensure that you know which [account type](./account-types) you need to create.** If you are unsure, please get in touch.

The balance of a real account is also held by ClearBank and can be viewed via the Institution portal and the ClearBank API. Real accounts are reconciled for you by ClearBank.

## Virtual GBP accounts

A virtual account held with ClearBank is a shadow account which should mirror an account held on your platform.
Each virtual account is linked to a real account held at ClearBank. You can use a virtual account to send and/or receive payments by means of its association with this real account.
The responsibility of managing and reconciling virtual accounts rests with you, which gives you complete control of such accounts.
