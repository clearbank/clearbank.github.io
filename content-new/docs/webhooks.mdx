## Overview

In response to some events, we generate and send out a webhook message to your defined URL.

Webhooks are asynchronous events and therefore we do not guarantee that they will be delivered in a set order. We do provide at-least-once delivery of webhooks, which means that webhooks may be sent more than once and so your webhook handlers must be idempotent.

> All ClearBank webhooks consist of a `DigitalSignature`, `Type`,`Version`,`Payload` and `Nonce`. `Payload` parameters vary depending on the webhook.
Webhook responses contain a 200 HTTP status code which includes a `Nonce` number in the body and your `DigitalSignature`.

### Anatomy of a webhook

| Element          | Type          | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DigitalSignature` | string        | ClearBank®'s Digital Signature                                                                           |
| `Type`             | string        | The type of the event                                                                                    |
| `Version`          | int           | The webhook version                                                                                      |
| `Nonce`            | int           | Cryptographically secure number generated by ClearBank® for every single webhook. A nonce number is generated randomly and should not be used as a check for duplication |
| `Payload`          | array[object] | Object which contains information related to the webhook |

### Response

| Element          | Type          | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DigitalSignature` | string      | Signed hash of the body of the request. The hash signed by your private key |
| `Nonce`            | int         | The value that you receive in the webhook                                   |
| `200 `             | int         | HTTP response status code                                                   |


## Responding to a webhook

The webhook sent by ClearBank® acts as a verification mechanism.
You verify that it is ClearBank® that has sent you the webhook and subsequently, ClearBank® needs to verify that you have successfully received the webhook (based on your response acknowledging receipt).
This verification occurs when you return a `200` HTTP response, which includes the `Nonce` number in the `response body`  and your `DigitalSignature`.
If your response is invalid, we will consider it as a failed webhook.
ClearBank® will send the webhook every 15 minutes for 24 hours unless a successful response is returned by you.

To verify the integrity of the webhook received from ClearBank®:
- Download a Public Key that is specific to your institution by clicking the **Download Public Key** button on the Webhook Management page of the Institution portal.
- Hash the request body using `SHA 256`
- Convert the `DigitalSignature` Request Header value from `Base64` encoded string into the byte array
- Verify the signature using the `RSA` algorithm

To create the webhook digital signature:
- Take the Nonce number from the webhook and place it in the body of the response (e.g. `{"nonce": <value>}`)
- Hash the response body using `SHA 256`
- Sign the hash with your `Private Key` and attach the signed hash as `Base64` encoded in the `DigitalSignature` Response Header

> Your Private Key needs to correspond to a Public Key which has been used to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Please refer to [creating your authentication profile](/#creating-your-authentication-profile) for more information.

Example HTTP request:
```
POST http://yourdomain.com/sample/webhook HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 72
Digitalsignature: YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
X-Request-Id: f0309d95-4f68-4ecd-9c8d-b2d08d9fedd8

{"Type":"FITestEvent","Version":1,"Payload":"test me","Nonce":1448545215}
```

Example HTTP response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Digitalsignature: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"Nonce": 1448545215
}
```

We have provided an example C# controller in the [ClearBank fi-api-101 Github Repository](https://github.com/clearbank/fi-api-101) which shows how to calculate the Hash value and verify the digital signature.

## Setting up and testing webhook listener URLs

You can create one webhook listener for all events or separate webhook listeners specific to an event.
In this example, you will setup an `FITestEvent` webhook URL, which you can test against the [`TEST POST` endpoint](#test-endpoints).

To manage your webhook definitions and set your webhook listener URLs for each event:
- Log in to the Institution Portal. More information about accessing the portal can be found [here](/#what-you-need-to-get-started).
- From the menu, select **Institution** > **Webhook Management**.
![alt text](/assets/images/webhook-management-page.png "webhook Management page")
- Search for **Test webhook** and click the **Edit button**.
- Enter the **URL** you want to define as your webhook listener for this webhook and set the webhook status to **Enabled**.
- Click Save to successfully setup the webhook listern URL.
- To test the webhook, click the **Test button**.
- Enter a test message in the Test webhook window for example, ‘Hello World’ and click **Send**.

You should receive a `FITestEvent webhook` to your nominated URL and it should contain the test message in the body.

**You must not include any sensitive information (such as API keys) in your webhook URLs.**

The range of public IP addresses to support your interaction with ClearBank® webhooks are:
- Simulation Public IP address range: `51.145.122.16/28`
- Production Public IP address range: `51.145.122.32/28`

<WebhookPlaceholder render='payment-message-assessment-failed-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='payment-message-validation-failed-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='transaction-rejected-v2' />

You may occasionally receive multiple webhooks with the same `EndtoEndTransactionId`. In this instance, a duplicate check should take place using the `TransactionId`.
If the same `TransactionId` is used for both payments, the webhook will be a duplicate. In case the TransactionId(s) are different, these will relate to separate transactions.

A full list of webhook documentation is available on ClearBank®'s Knowledge Centre and access can be granted as part of your onboarding journey. Please reach out to your main contact ClearBank® for more information.
