## Cheques

ClearBank accounts can support inbound cheques. If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your relationship manager.

You can submit cheques as TIFF or JPEG files using the [Submit a cheque](#Submit-a-cheque) endpoint. Alternatively, you can direct your customers to send cheques to your private client PO box, which you set up when you onboarded.

Once submitted, cheques take up to three working days to process. If the cheque passes validation, you will recieve the Cheque Paid and Transaction Settled webhooks. If the cheque fails validation or is over the limits you defined during onboarding, you will recieve a 400 response.

### Image requirements
For cheque images to successfully validate, they must satisfy the following requirements:
- Bitonal TIFF or JPEG, as base64 encoded string
- Image resolution of 200DPI
- CCITT Group 4 compression
- Front image compressed size: 600 to 90,000 bytes
- Rear image compressed size: 58 to 90,000 bytes.

Cheque images must also be clear, uncrumpled, and without folded corners.
