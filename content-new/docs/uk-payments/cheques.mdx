## Cheques

ClearBank accounts can support inbound cheques. If you'd like access to this product, please speak to your relationship manager.

You can submit cheques as image files using the [POST /v1/submitDeposit](#Submit-a-cheque) endpoint. Alternatively, you can direct your customers to send cheques to your private client PO box, which you set up when you were onboarded.

The message flow for cheques submitted via the endpoint is shown here.

![alt text](/assets/images/cheque_endpoint.svg "Message flow diagram explaining how to submit cheques via the endpoint. This is explained in the text below.")

You can submit a cheque image in either TIFF or JPEG file format.

Cheques take up to three working days to process. If the cheque passes processing, is submitted to the ICS scheme, and approved for payment, you will receive the [Cheque Paid](#cheque-paid-webhook) and [Transaction Settled](#transaction-settled-webhook) webhooks. If the cheque cannot be processed automatically, you will receive the [Cheque Reconciled](#cheque-reconciled-webhook) and [Transaction Settled](#transaction-settled-webhook) webhooks.

Scenarios where the cheque wouldn't process successfully include:
- If a decision is made by the issuing bank to not pay the cheque, or the check fails at the ICS scheme, you will receive the [Cheque Not Paid](#cheque-not-paid-webhook) webhook.
- If the cheque is over the limits you defined during onboarding, you will receive a 400 response when you submit the cheque.
- If a cheque cannot be submitted to the ICS scheme, for example, due to low image quality, on day 2 or 3 you will receive a manual response from ClearBank on Freshdesk.

**Cheques can also be submitted via post to the PO box you set up during onboarding.**

The message flow for cheques submitted by post is shown here.

![alt text](/assets/images/cheque_post.svg "Message flow diagram explaining how to submit cheques via post. In the 'Cheque Paid' outcome, once ClearBank receives the cheque in the post on day 1, if it passes processing you will receive the Cheque Paid and Transaction Settled webhooks on day 2 or 3. In the 'Cheque Not Paid' outcome, once ClearBank receives the cheque in the post on day 1, if it fails processing you will receive the Cheque Not Paid webhook on day 2 or 3.")

Postal cheques are processed the same way as cheques submitted via the endpoint.

#### Image requirements
For cheque images to successfully validate, they must satisfy the following requirements:
- Bitonal TIFF or JPEG, as base64 encoded string
- Image resolution of 200DPI
- CCITT Group 4 compression
- Front image compressed size: 600 to 90,000 bytes
- Rear image compressed size: 58 to 90,000 bytes.

Cheque images must also be clear, uncrumpled, and without folded corners.
