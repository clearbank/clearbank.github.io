## Overview

Placeholder text - ask Rachel what she wants.
Explain what the endpoint/webhooks are for; if their are restrictions (i.e. opening hours, things customers may not guess); anything customers have to do with onboarding (i.e. potentially talk to RM).

Nice to have: A diagram showing the endpoint and webhook return

Ask Rachel for meeting.
