## Cheques

ClearBank accounts support inbound cheques. 

Explain what the endpoint/webhooks are for; if their are restrictions (i.e. opening hours, things customers may not guess); anything customers have to do with onboarding (i.e. potentially talk to RM).

Ideally, add a diagram to explain.

<EndpointBlock
  type="post"
  title="Submit a cheque"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/v1/submitDeposit",
      version: "1.0Cheques",
       webhooks: [
        'transaction-settled-webhook-v6',
       ]
    }
  ]}
/>

<WebhookPlaceholder render='cheque-paid-webhook-v1' />
<WebhookPlaceholder render='cheque-not-paid-webhook-v1' />
