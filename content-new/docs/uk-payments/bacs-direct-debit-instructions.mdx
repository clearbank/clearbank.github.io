## Managing Direct Debit Instructions

A Direct Debit Instruction (DDI) is an authorisation to collect future payments from a nominated account.
A DDI can be submitted to ClearBank® by Service Users electronically via the Bacs Automated Direct Debit Instruction Service (AUDDIS) or sent as a paper instruction to your address to be entered via the ClearBank® API after you have validated it.
A DDI can be set up against real and virtual accounts held with ClearBank®.

If you are transferring an existing sort code to ClearBank® that already has DDIs set up, you will need to use the API to inform us of these.

## Returning Payments

If a DDI has been set up against an account via AUDDIS, payments may be collected from the account on the third day; for paper instructions, payments may be collected from the following day.
The timing of the payment is in the control of the service user and does not necessarily follow immediately.

ClearBank® will notify you with a Bacs Direct Debit Inbound Created webhook on Day 2 and confirmation of settlement will be provided with a Transaction Settled webhook on Day 3.

If the payment cannot be applied to the account, ClearBank® will automatically raise an Automated Return of Unpaid Direct Debits (ARUDD).
If the payment has been applied, but you still want to return it, you should use these endpoints and specify the reason for return.
ClearBank® will notify you with a Bacs Direct Debit Return Created webhook.
Returns can only be initiated until 15:30 (UTC) the working day after settlement. The payment will be applied to your Bacs Suspense account on the same day and returned on Day 5.
