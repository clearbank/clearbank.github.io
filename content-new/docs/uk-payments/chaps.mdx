## CHAPS

When sending payments via the ClearBank API, CHAPS are initiated via the POST /{vn}/Payments/CHAPS endpoint, while a confirmation of settlement is provided to you via the Transaction Settled webhook.
Please refer to [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) for more information.

ClearBank accounts support inbound and outbound CHAPS payments. Being that CHAPS is the UK’s high value payment scheme, there is no amount limit associated with inbound or outbound CHAPS payments.
However, you can only send CHAPS payments between 08:00 – 17:00 Monday to Friday (excluding UK public holidays).
