## CHAPS

ClearBank accounts support inbound and outbound CHAPS payments. As CHAPS is the UK’s high value payment scheme, there is no amount limit associated with inbound or outbound CHAPS payments.
However, you can only send CHAPS payments between 08:00 – 17:00 Monday to Friday (excluding UK public holidays).

- CHAPS payments can be sent using the [POST /v3/Payments/CHAPS](#send-a-chaps-payment) endpoint.
- Settlement details are provided to you via the [Transaction Settled](#transaction-settled-webhook) webhook. 
- If you need to return a CHAPS payment, you can do so using the [POST /payments/chaps/v4/return-payments](#return-a-chaps-payment) endpoint.
