## CHAPS

ClearBank accounts support inbound and outbound CHAPS payments. As CHAPS is the UK’s high value payment scheme, there is no amount limit associated with inbound or outbound CHAPS payments.
However, you can only send or return CHAPS payments between 08:00 – 17:00 Monday to Friday (excluding UK public holidays).

- CHAPS payments can be sent using the [POST /v4/payments/chaps-customer-payment](#send-a-chaps-payment) endpoint.
- Settlement details are provided to you via the [Transaction Settled](#transaction-settled-webhook) webhook. 
- If you need to return a CHAPS payment, you can do so using the [POST /payments/chaps/v4/return-payments](#return-a-chaps-payment) endpoint.

<Callout colour="blue">
  It is important to verify your firewall settings to ensure that they do not block <a href="#transaction-settled-webhook">Transaction Settled webhook</a> notifications, which can include a large payload due to the size of the Iso20022XmlDocument field.
</Callout>

## CHAPS simulation endpoints

These endpoints can be used to simulate payments. You can also use them for automated testing.

- Simulate an inbound CHAPS payment (pacs.008) through the [POST /inbound-payment-simulation/chaps/v1/customer-payments](#simulate-an-inbound-chaps-payment) endpoint.
- Simulate a returned CHAPS payment (pacs.004) through the [POST /inbound-payment-simulation/chaps/v1/return-payments](#simulate-a-return-chaps-payment) endpoint.
- Simulate a CHAPS bank-to-bank payment (pacs.009) through the [POST /inbound-payment-simulation/chaps/v1/institution-payments](#simulate-a-chaps-bank-to-bank-payment) endpoint.

The ClearBank Payment Simulator should no longer be used for CHAPS payments.
