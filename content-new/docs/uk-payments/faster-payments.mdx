## Faster Payments

When sending payments via the ClearBank API, Faster Payments are initiated via the POST /{vn}/Payments/FPS endpoint, and confirmation of settlement is provided to you via the Transaction Settled webhook.
Please refer to [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) for more information. 

Sometimes you will need to return a faster payment; for example, because the beneficiary name does not match that of the account number, because the account has been closed or transferred, or because the beneficiary has deceased. To do so, please use this new endpoint:  [/v3/payments/fps/return](#return-an-fps-payment). This can be used to return one single immediate payment.

ClearBank accounts support inbound and outbound Faster Payments. You can send and receive Faster Payments of up to £1,000,000. 
Faster Payments are not subject to a cut-off time and can be sent or received as and when required.

Please note that payments originating overseas need to be sent using a separate endpoint: [/v2/payments/fps/singlepayment](#send-a-faster-payment-originated-overseas).

**Faster Payments validation**

Each payment is validated against these rules: 

| Element     | Type   | Validation                                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
