## GBP Cross-Border

Cross-border payments are financial transactions where the payer and the recipient are based in separate countries. Our GBP Cross Border payment product enables you to send sterling payments to any sterling account, in any permissible overseas jurisdiction. 
Payments are guaranteed to settle on the same-day, as long as the instruction is received before 5pm UK time on that working day.

There is no limit to the amount that can be sent using this service.

You can send GBP cross-border payments using the [POST /payments/cross-border-sterling/v1/payments](#send-a-gpb-cross-border-payment) endpoint. 

Settlement details are provided to you via the [Transaction Settled](#transaction-settled-webhook) webhook. 

Things to note:

- You can initiate a payment during the sterling availability period, 08:00 to 17:00 (UK time), on business days. Payments sent after this window closes will be rejected with a 400 Bad Request response.
- You'll need to include a GBP Direct Participant in the intermediary agent field.
- You can recognise a Transaction Settled webhook that describes a GBP Cross-Border payment by checking the **TransactionSource** is set to **Cross Border GBP**.


<Callout colour="blue">
  It is important to verify your firewall settings to ensure that they do not block <a href="#transaction-settled-webhook">Transaction Settled webhook</a> notifications, which can include a large payload due to the size of the Iso20022XmlDocument field.
</Callout>

The GBP Cross-Border endpoint supports the new ISO20022 payment message formats, specifically pacs.008.
