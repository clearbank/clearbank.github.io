## Get connected

Before you can integrate with our API, you need to have been onboarded by us as a customer and have a valid authentication profile set up.
This authentication profile includes your Digital Certificate and secure API token. The API token needs to be included in the header of all REST API calls.
You can find information about how to generate these in our [introduction section](/docs/introduction).

## Use endpoints

### Common Parameters

We utilise HTTP-request headers for our API calls which include `Authorization`, `DigitalSignature` and `X-Request-Id` headers. In all our responses we will send an `X-Correlation-Id` in the header.

`GET` requests have an `Authorization` header.

NON-GET requests such as `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` have an `Authorization` header.

import ParameterDetails from 'src/components/parameter-details'
import parameters from './parameters.json'

<ParameterDetails parameter={parameters.authorization} />
<ParameterDetails parameter={parameters.digitalSignature} />
<ParameterDetails parameter={parameters.xRequestId} />
<ParameterDetails parameter={parameters.xCorrelationId} />

### Authenticate your API calls

We use your API token to authenticate your requests and allow you to securely access protected resources.

The base URL for your environment is either:
- Simulation `https://institution-api-sim.clearbank.co.uk/`
- Production `https://institution-api.clearbank.co.uk/`

Your API token should be included in your HTTP `Authorization` header. Please refer to [Common Parameters](#common-parameters]) for more information.

This example request shows the API token in the `Authorization` , `DigitalSignature` and `X-Request-Id` header.

``` json
curl -v -POST https://institution-api-sim.clearbank.co.uk/v1/Test \
  -H “Authorization: Bearer <<your api token>>”
  -H “DigitalSignature: <<digitalsignature>>”
  -H “X-Request-Id: <<X-request-ID>>”      
  -d ‘{ "body": "hello world!" }’      
```

The response shows results from the test call
``` json
{
	"Message": "hello world!"
}
```

To confirm that authentication and signature verification are working as expected, when you send a POST/v1/Test request you will receive a `FITestEvent webhook` from ClearBank® (if you are subscribed to it).
We use webhooks to deliver transaction confirmation notifications and account-specific reconciliations to your system as soon as such events occur on your account. Please refer to [Test Webhooks](/webhooks/) for more information.

#### TEST Endpoints

  type="get"
  title="Test"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/v1/Test",
      version: "1.0",
      title: "GET Accounts",
    }
  ]}
/>

<EndpointBlock

      version: "1.0",
      title: "POST Test",
    }
  ]}
/>

### Query Parameters

For most of our `GET` requests, one or more query parameters in the request URL can be used to specify the number of returned results and the number of pages returned.

| Parameter    | Type | Description                                                                                                 |
|--------------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pageNumber` | int  | The page number to control returned results into manageable sets. Default if not supplied: 1 `pageNumber=1` |
| `pageSize`   | int  | The page size to control returned results into manageable sets. Default if not supplied: 50 `pageSize=50`   |

### HTTP Status Codes

ClearBank® requests return a HTTP status code to indicate the success or failure of a request. For successful requests, we return a HTTP `2XX` status code. For failed requests, we return a HTTP `4XX` or `5XX` status code. Some endpoints return JSON response bodies that include errors and additional properties.


| Status Code | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200`       | Success!                                                                                                                                            |
| `201`       | Success!                                                                                                                                            |
| `202`       | Request received successfully and is being processed                                                                                               |
| `400`       | Bad request. Something went wrong with the request. The response should include the reason why the request has failed                               |
| `403`       | Forbidden. Your API token does not have permissions to perform the request                                                                          |
| `404`       | Not found. The resource you are looking for cannot be found                                                                                         |
| `409`       | Conflict. A request conflict with the current state of the server
| `429`       | Too many requests. You have sent too many requests in a given time ("rate limiting")                                                                                     |
| `500`       | Internal server error                                                                                                                           |
| `503`       | Server error. Service unavailable                                                                                                                   |


#### 5xx status codes
If you receive a 5xx error code, you should retry your request as these are service errors. A request that returns these errors may, in exceptional circumstances, result in being processed regardless. Following which, you will receive a notification (webhook) delivered to you as expected. 

To avoid any duplication, always retry all such requests with exactly the same request Id header and payload. If the initial request is successful, the retry request will trigger a notification (HTTP response or webhook) to confirm that it has not been processed as it was identified as a duplicate.

#### Example of a response containing detailed errors

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "additionalProp1": [
      "string"
    ],
    "additionalProp2": [
      "string"
    ],
    "additionalProp3": [
      "string"
    ]
  },
  "type": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "status": 0,
  "detail": "string",
  "instance": "string"
}
```

### HAL Links

We use HAL (Hypertext Application Language) to hyperlink between resources in our API.

Each HAL hyperlink contains:

| Parameter   | Type      | Required | Description                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`      | `string`  | Required | The named link type                                                                                                       |
| `href`      | `string`  | Required | URI to be used                                                                                                            |
| `templated` | `boolean` |          | Specified as `true` if href is a URI template, i.e. with parameters. Otherwise, this property is absent or set to `false` |

## Subscribe to webhooks

### Overview

In response to some events, we generate and send out a webhook message to your defined URL.

> All ClearBank webhooks consist of a `DigitalSignature`, `Type`,`Version`,`Payload` and `Nonce`. `Payload` parameters vary depending on the webhook.
Webhook responses contain a 200 HTTP status code which includes a `Nonce` number in the body and your `DigitalSignature`.

### Anatomy of a webhook

| Element          | Type          | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DigitalSignature` | string        | ClearBank®'s Digital Signature                                                                           |
| `Type`             | string        | The type of the event                                                                                    |
| `Version`          | int           | The webhook version                                                                                      |
| `Nonce`            | int           | Cryptographically secure number generated by ClearBank® for every single webhook. A nonce number is generated randomly and should not be used as a check for duplication |
| `Payload`          | array[object] | Object which contains information related to the webhook |

### Response

| Element          | Type          | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DigitalSignature` | string      | Signed hash of the body of the request. The hash signed by your private key |
| `Nonce`            | int         | The value that you receive in the webhook                                   |
| `200 `             | int         | HTTP response status code                                                   |

### Responding to a webhook

The webhook sent by ClearBank® acts as a verification mechanism.
You verify that it is ClearBank® that has sent you the webhook and subsequently, ClearBank® needs to verify that you have successfully received the webhook (based on your response acknowledging receipt).
This verification occurs when you return a `200` HTTP response, which includes the `Nonce` number in the `response body`  and your `DigitalSignature`.
If your response is invalid, we will consider it as a failed webhook.
ClearBank® will send the webhook every 15 minutes for 24 hours unless a successful response is returned by you.

To verify the integrity of the webhook received from ClearBank®:
- Download a Public Key that is specific to your institution by clicking the **Download Public Key** button on the Webhook Management page of the Institution portal.
- Hash the request body using `SHA 256`
- Convert the `DigitalSignature` Request Header value from `Base64` encoded string into the byte array
- Verify the signature using the `RSA` algorithm

To create the webhook digital signature:
- Take the Nonce number from the webhook and place it in the body of the response (e.g. `{"nonce": <value>}`)
- Hash the response body using `SHA 256`
- Sign the hash with your `Private Key` and attach the signed hash as `Base64` encoded in the `DigitalSignature` Response Header

> Your Private Key needs to correspond to a Public Key which has been used to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Please refer to [creating your authentication profile](/#creating-your-authentication-profile) for more information.

Example HTTP request:
```
POST http://yourdomain.com/sample/webhook HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 72
Digitalsignature: YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
X-Request-Id: f0309d95-4f68-4ecd-9c8d-b2d08d9fedd8

{"Type":"FITestEvent","Version":1,"Payload":"test me","Nonce":1448545215}
```

Example HTTP response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Digitalsignature: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"Nonce": 1448545215
}
```

### Setting up and testing webhook listener URLs

You can create one webhook listener for all events or separate webhook listeners specific to an event.
In this example, you will setup an `FITestEvent` webhook URL, which you can test against the [`TEST POST` endpoint](#test-endpoints).

To manage your webhook definitions and set your webhook listener URLs for each event:
- Log in to the Institution Portal. More information about accessing the portal can be found [here](/#what-you-need-to-get-started).
- From the menu, select **Institution** > **Webhook Management**.
![alt text](/assets/images/webhook-management-page.png "webhook Management page")
- Search for **Test webhook** and click the **Edit button**.
- Enter the **URL** you want to define as your webhook listener for this webhook and set the webhook status to **Enabled**.
- Click Save to successfully setup the webhook listern URL.
- To test the webhook, click the **Test button**.
- Enter a test message in the Test webhook window for example, ‘Hello World’ and click **Send**.

You should receive a `FITestEvent webhook` to your nominated URL and it should contain the test message in the body.

**You must not include any sensitive information (such as API keys) in your webhook URLs.**

The range of public IP addresses to support your interaction with ClearBank® webhooks are:
- Simulation Public IP address range: `51.145.122.16/28`
- Production Public IP address range: `51.145.122.32/28`
