title: "Outbound Transaction Held Webhook"  
version: 1  
webhook: true
---

**This webhook confirms that an outbound transaction has been held.**

The UK financial sanctions legislation requires that all funds or economic resources belonging to, owned, held or controlled by a designated person must be frozen and reported to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). Therefore, whenever an outbound transaction is held by ClearBank for compliance reasons, we hold the transaction in a state of Clearing or Pending and send you an Outbound Held Transaction webhook.

You will not have access to funds associated with a held transaction until a decision is made. In some cases, we may contact your Compliance department for more information, in order to make an informed decision.

If we release a held transaction, the Transaction Settled webhook is raised.  
If we decline a held transaction, funds associated with the held transaction are returned to you and the Transaction Rejected webhook with the CancellationCode of HOPRJ is raised.
