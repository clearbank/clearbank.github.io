#### Example ISA Remaining Subscription Allowance Updated webhook request body

```json
{
    "Type":"IsaRemainingSubscriptionAllowanceUpdated",
    "Version": 1,
    "Payload":
    {
        "AccountId": "57d56e32-efca-49e7-a71f-8eb18d72c162",
        "TaxYear": "24/25",
        "CashIsaStatus": "Active",
        "NetSubscription": 8000.00,
        "RemainingSubscriptionAllowance": 10000.00,
        "AnnualAllowanceUsed": 8000.00,
        "RemainingSubscriptionAllowanceUpdatedDateTime": "2024-10-20T09:54:44.000209Z"
    },
    "Nonce": 5582946458
}
```

In this example, the customer has deposited £2,000 into a different cash ISA held with ClearBank, decreasing the **RemainingSubscriptionAllowance** from £12,000 to £10,000. TODO: move example to top, make it a full example with 3 ISAs
