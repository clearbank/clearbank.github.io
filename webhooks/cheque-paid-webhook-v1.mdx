**This webhook confirms a Bacs Unpaid Direct Debit has been received.**

The Direct Debit service user receives notification that a Direct Debit
could not be paid from an account. Hence, the money needs to be
returned and you must ensure that the account has sufficient funds.

This webhook arrives on day 4 or 5 in relation to the original Direct
Debit, and is settled on the working day following the processing day specified.
