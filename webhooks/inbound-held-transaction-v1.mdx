title: "Inbound Transaction Held webhook"  
version: 1  
webhook: true
---

**This webhook confirms that an inbound transaction has been held.**

The UK financial sanctions legislation requires that all funds or economic resources belonging to, owned, held or controlled by a designated person must be frozen and reported to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). Therefore, whenever an inbound transaction is held by ClearBank for compliance reasons, we apply the funds to a suspense account and send you an Inbound Held Transaction webhook.  

Funds associated with a held transaction remain in a suspense account until a decision is made. In some cases, we may contact your compliance department for more information in order to make an informed decision.  

* If we release a held transaction, the Transaction Settled webhook is raised.  
* If we decline a held transaction, funds associated with the held transaction are returned to the remitting bank.
