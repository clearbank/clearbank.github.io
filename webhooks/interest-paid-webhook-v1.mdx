title: "Interest Paid webhook"
version: 1
webhook: true
---

This webhook confirms that interest has been paid on the posting day for both the end customer and the embedded baking customer. It will also trigger for the outstanding accrual payment for account closures. A [Transaction Settled webhook](../gbp-payments/faster-payments#transaction-settled-webhook) will be received at the same time and these can be matched using the `TransactionID` field in both.

Note that the `DestinationAccountID` refers to the savings account/cash ISA account holding the balance that the interest is calculated against.
